Everything the pipeline reads or writes at runtime lives under one `data/` directory

store, and generated upload CSVs. The manufacturer registry and reviewers list are
hand-maintained inputs rather than runtime output, so they live under a separate
`config/` directory instead. This module is the single place that knows both layouts,
