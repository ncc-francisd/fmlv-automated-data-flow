"""Applying approved decisions to the baseline, and writing the upload CSV.

DESIGN.md §6.3: accept/reject/correct is *per field*, so a run's approved output is
assembled one field at a time — start from the baseline row (or a blank one for a
`NEW_PRODUCT`), then apply every `accept`/`correct`/`blank` decision on top of it. A
`reject`, or a proposal never decided at all, leaves that field exactly as the baseline
had it.
Carry-through fields (DESIGN.md §4.2) are untouched by construction: they're copied
from the baseline `Motorhome` and no adapter ever proposes a change to them (the one
exception, `year`, is handled the same way as any other field — see
`store/changes.py`'s year-rollover note).

A product with no `accept`/`correct`/`blank` decision at all contributes nothing to
the output — there is nothing approved to upload for it.

`blank` is the odd one out and is deliberately in that list: it is the only decision
whose approved value is *emptiness*, so a product whose sole decision is a `blank`
still contributes a row — one that clears a column FMLV currently fills.

    Globebus Active I1, whose own downloadable price list publishes a fridge freezer:
    *"the output […] states no for fridge or fridge/freezer. This is more worrying in some
    ways."*

    Since the habitation fields became findings, nothing in the review answers them and
    nobody accepts anything, so that `No` is the default outcome rather than a decision.
    Blanking the columns makes the row say what is true — nobody has answered yet — and
    turns the person's job into filling a gap they can see, which is what was asked for:
    *"we could leave it to humans to add those elements to the CSV."*

    **The blank is a gate, and that is the point — do not "fix" it back to `No`.** FMLV
    will not accept a row with an empty cell in one of these columns, so the upload fails
    until a person has filled them in. The requester, 9 September 2026, told which way that
    cuts: *"I don't mind empty cells on this CSV actually because, although it won't upload
    to FMLV with empty cells, it highlights that we need to fill them in and we can see
    them. So I think it's actually better to be blank."* A `No` would upload cleanly and be
    wrong; a blank cannot go out unnoticed.

    That is also why this is confined to the habitation columns. A blank anywhere the
    pipeline is genuinely responsible for would stop an upload nobody needs to intervene
    in, which is a different and unwelcome thing.

    A field a decision *did* answer keeps its answer. That is not reachable from a finding,
    but a run stored before the change carries real `bed_types` proposals a reviewer can
    still decide, and this must not blank one of those out from under them.
