"""Classifying every scraped and baseline product into one of four outcomes.

DESIGN.md §6.5 treats "verified unchanged" as a first-class result, not silence, and
TODO.md's Phase 5 asks for exactly four classifications: new product, changed field,
unchanged-confirmed, disappeared. This module ties `matching.py` and `compare.py`
together to produce one `ProductDiff` per scraped product plus one per baseline
product that went unmatched — nothing is ever silently dropped.
