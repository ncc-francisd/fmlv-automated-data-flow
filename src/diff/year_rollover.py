"""Model-year rollover — DESIGN.md §9 open question 1, resolved.

`year` is a carry-through field (`fmlv/schema.py`: "PLEASE Leave as is!") and this
pipeline never bumps it automatically. Advancing it is always a human decision, made
one of two ways:

1. **Globally**, for every product of a manufacturer, as a parameter supplied when a
   run is triggered (Phase 8's CLI — not built yet). `bump_year` is the primitive that
   flag will call, one product at a time.
2. **Per product, at review time** (Phase 6's UI — not built yet), where a change was
   actually detected during the window manufacturers typically publish next year's
   models. `in_rollover_window` is a plausibility signal for that window, surfaced on
   `ProductDiff.year_rollover_eligible` (`classify.py`) for the review app to render as
   a checkbox — it never forces a bump by itself.

Deliberately not the same window as DESIGN.md §8's "August-September is peak season"
note — that one is about how *often to run the pipeline*; this one is about how
*plausible a detected change is a model-year rollover*.

**The window runs to the end of the calendar year, 1 June to 31 December**, widened from
30 September on 1 October 2026. Two reasons. Manufacturers were still landing next year's
range well past September — Carthago and Adria were both publishing 2027 vehicles that
week — so a 30 September cut-off asserted something about the trade that is not true. And
31 December is where the window has to stop anyway: `can_bump_year` only ever offers to
turn *this calendar year's* model into next year's, so on 1 January a 2026 product stops
being bumpable by either route, window or no window.
