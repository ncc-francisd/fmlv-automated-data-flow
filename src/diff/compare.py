"""Field-level diff between a baseline product and a freshly scraped one.

Works for either product area. What differs between motorhomes and caravans — which
fields are in scope, which numerics are "the job", which flags are layout — is held in a
`FieldProfile` per area rather than branched on at each use.

Only fields the adapter actually extracted are compared. `ExtractedMotorhome.provenance`
(`adapters/base.py`) is the record of what an adapter looked at and found — a field
with no provenance entry simply wasn't attempted. Treating a missing provenance entry
as "the value is now blank" would wrongly propose clearing data the adapter never
visited: Adria's adapter, for instance, never attempts the ~40 layout flags at all
(docs/adapters/adria.md), so none of them should ever show up as a "changed" layout
field for an Adria product.
