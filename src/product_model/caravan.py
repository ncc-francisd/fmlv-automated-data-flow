"""The canonical touring caravan.

One instance == one row of the FMLV touring-caravan export == one NCC product. The
sibling of `model.Motorhome`, and deliberately a **separate class rather than a
generalisation of it**: the two exports differ in twenty columns, and a single model
covering both would carry a base vehicle that caravans never have, a rear garage they
cannot have, and four dimension fields whose meaning changes with the product area.

Fields are as permissive as `Motorhome`'s and for the same reason — real exports carry
gaps, and a reader that raises on those is useless for the job. `validation.check_caravan`
reports problems as data.
