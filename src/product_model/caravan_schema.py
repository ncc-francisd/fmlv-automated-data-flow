"""The FMLV touring-caravan export schema.

The sibling of `schema.py`. Column order is taken verbatim from a real NCC export
(`data/exports/28_Bailey/…_touring-caravans.xlsx`, 81 products, cross-checked against
Adria's 11) and must be preserved on upload.

**Where it differs from the motorhome schema** — 62 columns against 68, and the overlap
is less than the count suggests:

* **No base vehicle.** A caravan is towed, so `base_vehicle_manufacturer`,
  `mh_passenger_seats_inc_driver` and the four `automatic_*` gearbox columns have no
  caravan equivalent. `rear_garage` and `sleeping_area_separate_childrens_area` are gone
  too.
* **Different body types** — rigid/folding/pop-up/micro rather than the eight
  campervan and coachbuilt shapes (`enums.CaravanBodyType`).
* **Renamed dimensions.** `mh_length_mm`/`mh_width_mm`/`mh_height_mm` become
  `exterior_body_length_mm`/`overall_width_mm`/`height_mm`.
* **Four lengths, not one**, and telling them apart matters more than the names admit:
  `internal_length_mm` is the habitable space; `exterior_body_length_mm` is the body;
  `shipping_length_mm` adds the towing hitch, so it is always the larger of the two (by
  845-1500mm across Bailey's range); and `awning_length_mm` is the awning rail
  measurement rather than a vehicle dimension at all, running to 11557mm on a van less
  than half that long. Mapping shipping and exterior body the wrong way round would be
  quiet, plausible and wrong on every product at once.
* **Split payload.** There is no single payload column. `mtplm - mro` is
  `personal_effects_payload_kilograms` plus `optional_equipment_payload_kilograms`, and
  the latter is populated on **none** of the 92 real caravan products this project holds
  — so in practice the check is `mtplm - mro == personal_effects`.
* **Two extras with no motorhome counterpart**: `twin_axle` and `headroom_mm`.
