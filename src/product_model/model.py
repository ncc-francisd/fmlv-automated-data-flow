"""The canonical motorhome product.

One instance == one row of the FMLV motorhome/campervan export == one NCC product.

Fields are deliberately permissive (almost everything is optional). Real exports carry
gaps and the occasional inconsistency, and a reader that raises on those is useless for
the job. Instead the shape is enforced by `validation.check`, which reports problems as
data rather than exceptions so they can be shown to the reviewer.
