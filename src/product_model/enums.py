"""Grouped layout attributes from the FMLV export schemas.

The export represents these as ~40 independent Yes/No columns, but the field guide
(`config/field_guide_motorhome.csv`) shows they are really constrained groups:
most are "select YES against ONE option", one (bed types) is "select YES against ALL
that apply", and refrigeration is "do not put YES in both columns".

Modelling them as enums rather than booleans means an extractor picks from a closed
list, a diff reads as ``bathroom_layout: rear -> side`` instead of two boolean flips,
and the exactly-one rule is enforced by the type rather than by a check.

Each member's value is the FMLV column it expands to, so writing back is mechanical.
