"""The FMLV motorhome/campervan export schema.

Column order here is taken verbatim from a real NCC export
(`csv-examples/.../motorhome-campervans.xlsx`) and must be preserved on upload.

The field guide splits these columns into classes that behave very differently, and
the pipeline treats them differently as a result:

* ``CARRY_THROUGH`` — marked "PLEASE Leave as is!". Read from the current export and
  written back untouched. Never extracted, never diffed.
* ``REQUIRED`` — must be present for a row to be valid on upload.
* ``LAYOUT`` — the ~40 Yes/No columns, modelled internally as the enums in `enums.py`.
* ``DEALER_ONLY`` — "LEAVE BLANK UNLESS DEALER EXCLUSIVE". Not available from
  manufacturer sites, so out of scope for scraping.
