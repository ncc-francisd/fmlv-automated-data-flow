#: Single-select layout groups worth flagging when unset on an existing product.
#: Refrigeration is deliberately excluded — the guide phrases it as "at most one"
#: (fridge/fridge_freezer/neither), not "select one", so an unset value is valid.
#:
#: Public because `store.changes.persist_diff` reads it too: a **new** product with one of
#: these unset now gets a row in the review, rather than only a warning hours later at
#: upload. The Rimor Van 238 shipped with four of them blank because the adapter has no
#: floorplan for it and so recorded nothing at all — leaving the reviewer no row to see.

#: The shortest a real motorhome or campervan can be. The smallest vehicle this project
#: has seen is a 5.4m campervan, so 4m is well clear of anything legitimate while still
#: catching a mis-keyed or mis-parsed figure. Bailey's own Endeavour B65 page published
#: `Overall Body Length: 1.951m` (the truth, given by a comparison table further down
#: that same page, is 5.980m); the adapter read it faithfully, a reviewer accepted it,
#: and nothing downstream objected, so a 1.9m campervan reached FMLV on 20 Aug 2026.
#: Once the baseline and the site agree on a wrong figure the diff reports it as
#: verified-unchanged, which is precisely when a reviewer stops being shown it — hence a
#: floor here, in the shared layer every adapter's upload passes through, rather than in
#: the one adapter whose source happened to be wrong.
