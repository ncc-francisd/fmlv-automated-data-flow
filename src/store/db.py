"""SQLite connection management for the run store.

One file, opened with foreign keys enforced and rows returned as `sqlite3.Row` so
callers can access columns by name. The schema (`schema.sql`) is applied idempotently
on every connect via `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` — there is no separate migration
step yet. That's fine while the schema is still settling; once real run history
exists, evolving it will need a proper migration (see TODO.md).

`_ADDED_COLUMNS` is the one exception: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` doesn't add columns
to a table that already exists, so a column added to `schema.sql` after a database was
first created needs its own `ALTER TABLE`, applied idempotently by checking
`PRAGMA table_info` first (SQLite has no `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`).

Constraints need more than that — SQLite can't alter a CHECK or UNIQUE clause at all, so
changing one means rebuilding the table. `_migrate_decision_undo_action` and
`_migrate_product_vehicle_class_unique_key` are those rebuilds, and both matter because
real review history already exists on the deployed VM.

    The rebuild goes via a new table rather than `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO product_old`
    the way `_migrate_decision_undo_action` does. That shortcut is safe for `decision`
    because nothing references it; `product` is referenced by `proposed_change`,
    `verification` and `disappearance_notice`, and a modern SQLite rewrites those
    `REFERENCES` clauses to follow a rename — which would silently re-point every child
    table at `product_old` and then leave them dangling when it was dropped.

    Foreign keys must be off for the drop-and-rename, which `connect` arranges by running
    every migration before enabling them.
