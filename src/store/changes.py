"""Turning a run's diff (Phase 5's `diff.diff_products`) into durable rows.

`diff_products` is a pure, in-memory function — this module is where its output
becomes something a reviewer can act on: `proposed_change` rows for anything that
changed or is new, `verification` rows for anything checked and confirmed unchanged
(DESIGN.md §6.5). `ChangeKind.DISAPPEARED` is deliberately not persisted here — there's
no actionable proposal for it yet (proposing `archived = Yes` is still [F], see
TODO.md Phase 5).

DESIGN.md §6.8 ("rejections are remembered") is enforced in `was_previously_rejected`:
a proposed change is skipped if the exact same (product, field, new_value) was
rejected last time. A manufacturer later publishing a *different* corrected figure for
that field is a new proposal and is still shown — only the literal rejected value is
suppressed.

A `year_rollover_eligible` product (DESIGN.md §6.9) gets one more proposal beyond
what `diff.compare` found: a `field="year"` change from the baseline's year to
`year_rollover.bump_year`'s result. This is deliberately routed through the exact
same `proposed_change`/`decision` machinery as every other field — accepting it *is*
the "checkbox" TODO.md's Phase 5 entry described, rather than a separate mechanism.
Its `source_url` is `None` and its snippet says so: the suggestion comes from the
pipeline noticing the season, not from anything read off the manufacturer's site.

`bump_year_all` is §6.9's *other* route, the one the CLI's `--bump-year` passes:
the same proposal, for every product of the manufacturer rather than only the
seasonally plausible ones. Both routes converge here deliberately — a globally
requested rollover is still reviewed and accepted per product, and the pipeline
still never writes `year` on its own. Neither route proposes a bump unless the
baseline's `year` is exactly today's year — `year_rollover.can_bump_year` gates it,
so a product already sitting at `current_year + 1` (bumped and accepted earlier) or
still showing some older, stale year is never offered one.

`ChangeKind.DISAPPEARED` **is** persisted here, as a `disappearance_notice` row rather
than being dropped: a product missing from a manufacturer's latest sweep is exactly
the kind of thing a reviewer needs put in front of them, not silence. It is
deliberately *not* a `proposed_change` — there is no CSV field to change, since the
product hasn't been archived, only found missing from the site this sweep — so it
carries no accept/reject/correct affordance. It is a prompt for a reviewer to go and
consider manually deactivating the product on the FMLV Nova site themselves.
