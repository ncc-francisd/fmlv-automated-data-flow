"""The review app: FastAPI + HTMX, per DESIGN.md §6.3.

"Others will run and maintain this, not just the author, and reviewer time is the
real bottleneck" — so the app is deliberately small: a home page linking to the two
things a reviewer does (trigger a run, review runs), a run list, and a per-field
accept/reject/correct form that submits via HTMX and swaps just that row back in, no
client-side JavaScript of our own.

`create_app(db_path)` is a factory rather than a module-level app object so tests can
point it at a throwaway SQLite file. `get_connection` is a *module-level* dependency
(not a closure over `app`) reading `request.app.state.db_path`, deliberately — a
closure-based dependency defined inside `create_app` can't be resolved here: this
file uses `from __future__ import annotations`, which stringifies every annotation,
and FastAPI resolves those strings against each function's module globals, not an
enclosing function's locals. Every route opens its own connection and closes it at
the end of the request, sidestepping `sqlite3`'s one-thread-per-connection rule
without needing a long-lived connection pool at this scale.

Triggering a run from the browser (`/trigger`) runs the real pipeline
(`cli.execute_run`) — fetches, PDFs, a headless browser — which can take minutes, so
it can't run inline in the request. It's handed to a worker thread via
`asyncio.to_thread`; the request waits only for `execute_run`'s `on_run_started`
callback to fire (an in-process DB insert, near-instant) and then redirects to the new
run's detail page, which shows "in progress" until the background thread finishes.

A scheduled run (`config/schedule.csv`, DESIGN.md's original plan for this was a
separate Windows Task Scheduler job) is instead driven from *inside* this same
process: `create_app` starts an APScheduler `BackgroundScheduler` on the FastAPI
`lifespan`, polling `_check_schedule` every `schedule_check_interval_minutes`. That
scheduler runs jobs on its own worker thread pool — not the asyncio event loop this
app otherwise runs on — so `_check_schedule` calls `execute_run` directly rather than
via `asyncio.to_thread`, the same way a synchronous CLI invocation would. One process
covers both "review this in a browser" and "keep the schedule ticking", rather than
running a separate always-on scheduler service alongside it.
