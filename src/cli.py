"""The command line: `fmlv run <manufacturer>`.

Every stage this drives already exists as a library and is tested on its own — until
now nothing performed the *sequence*, which is the one thing no unit test covers. So
this module is deliberately only wiring and reporting: resolve the registry row, start
a `run` record, hand the fetchers to that manufacturer's adapter, diff what comes back
against the baseline export, and persist the result for the review app (DESIGN.md §5).

Four decisions worth knowing about:

* **The baseline is filtered to one manufacturer before diffing, archived rows and
  stale model years are dropped, and same-range/model duplicates are collapsed to the
  newest model year.** `diff.match_products` requires the manufacturer filter and
  nothing enforces it — an unfiltered baseline would let one brand's product match
  another brand's row. The filter is `Motorhome.manufacturer ==
  Manufacturer.fmlv_manufacturer`, which is precisely what that registry column exists
  to guarantee. Rows with `archived=Yes` are excluded too: they're gone from FMLV
  already, so there's nothing to diff a scraped product against.
  `_is_current_model_year` excludes everything except this calendar year and next —
  FMLV keeps every model year a manufacturer has ever listed, and only the current and
  next year's models are ever live for sale, so anything older is noise for the diff.
  `_dedupe_baseline` handles a third case found on a real Swift run: the export can
  carry two *non-archived* rows for the same `manufacturer_range`/`model` under
  different `product_id`s (an older listing FMLV never archived when the newer one was
  added). Left alone, one scraped product matches one of the two, the other goes
  unmatched and is proposed for archiving — but `store.products.upsert_seen`'s
  range/model fallback then folds that archive proposal onto the *same* product row as
  the match's field changes, since the two duplicates are indistinguishable by
  range/model alone. Keeping only the row with the higher `year` (ties broken by
  leaving the first one seen) avoids ever creating the DISAPPEARED half of that pair;
  the discarded duplicates are exactly what a human would call archived, so this is a
  baseline-quality fix, not a matching one.

* **A run that raises is still recorded**, as `status='failed'` with the message,
  rather than left stuck at `'running'` forever. Whatever was snapshotted before the
  failure stays on disk, so a half-finished run is still debuggable.

* **`--bump-year` is route 1 of DESIGN.md §6.9** — the model-year rollover applied to
  every product of a manufacturer on explicit human instruction. It proposes the bump
  as an ordinary `proposed_change` row that still has to be accepted in the review app;
  it does not write `year` anywhere by itself. Route 2 (the per-product suggestion
  during the June–September window) needs no flag and happens regardless.

* **The fetcher factories are injectable** (`_fetcher_factory` / `_browser_factory`,
  following the same underscore convention as `fetch.http.Fetcher`'s `_sleep`) so that
  `execute_run` — the whole pipeline, the interesting part — is testable without a
  network or a Chromium process.
