"""Bailey (baileyofbristol.co.uk) — touring caravans. The first caravan adapter.

The sibling of `bailey.py`, and a separate module rather than a flag on it: FMLV keeps
motorhomes and touring caravans as separate exports with separate schemas, so this one
produces `Caravan`s and registers under `(Bailey, caravan)`. See `docs/adapters/bailey.md`
for the motorhome survey; the caravan section of that file covers what follows.

**The site is as clean here as it is for motorhomes** — one URL is one vehicle, at
`/touring-caravans/<range>/<slug>/`, plain server-rendered HTML with a "Technical
specification" section carrying explicit literal `Range` and `Model` fields. The
`col-6` markup is identical, so every parsing helper is imported from `bailey.py`
unchanged rather than reimplemented:

    Range                 Pegasus Black
    Model                 Messina
    Berths                4
    Axle                  Twin
    Internal Length       6.332m / 20'9"
    Shipping Length       7.905m / 25'11"
    Overall Width         2.433m / 8'0"
    Overall Height        2.582m / 8'6"
    Internal Headroom     1.960m / 6'5"
    Awning Size           1089.1cm
    MTPLM                 1712kg
    MRO                   1552kg
    Total User Payload    160kg
    RRP Price             £34,499

**Three things this adapter does not do, each for a stated reason.**

*No exterior body length.* Bailey publish internal and shipping length and nothing
between them — the field does not appear on any of the 23 model pages. The requester's
reading (3 September 2026) is that this is an industry trend rather than one brand's
omission, so `exterior_body_length_mm` was taken out of automated scope in
`config/field_guide_caravan.csv` entirely. Whatever FMLV already holds is left alone.

*No layout flags.* The pages describe the layout in marketing prose — "parallel seat
front lounge and rear island king size bed" — and a bed-sizes block naming Front Double,
Front N/S Single and Rear Fixed Double. That is enough to guess from and not enough to be
right, and a wrong layout flag is worse than a visible gap. `bailey.py` takes the same
line: it sets `body_type` only because Bailey state the roof profile outright.

*No `optional_equipment_payload_kilograms`.* Out of scope, and blank on all 92 real
caravan products FMLV holds.

**Body type is always rigid.** Not inferred — stated by the requester, and true of all 81
Bailey caravans in FMLV. The micro rule (manufacturer's own naming *and* MTPLM ≤ 1250kg)
never fires here: Bailey market nothing as a micro, and the four products under that
weight are all held as rigid.

The reason given in the provenance is deliberately the **general** rule rather than a claim
about what Bailey happen to build: a caravan is rigid unless its *walls* fold or rise, so a
lifting roof does not change the type even where the manufacturer's own spec sheet calls it
a pop-up (NCC, 7 September 2026 — see `docs/adapters/README.md`). Stating it as "Bailey
build only rigid caravans" would read as falsified the first time they ship a pop-top, and
would invite someone to change this line when the rule says not to.

**Two range names are abbreviated in the spec table.** It gives `Pegasus Black` and
`Phoenix Black`; FMLV holds `Pegasus Black Edition` and `Phoenix Black Edition`. The
requester confirmed the longer form is the real name — the brochure and the URL slug both
carry "Edition", and only the specification template drops it. Note the page's own `<h1>`
and `<title>` abbreviate it too, so there is no better in-page source to read instead:
hence an explicit correction table, the same resolution `bailey.py` uses for
`Autograph` -> `Autograph IV`.

#: What makes this adapter the caravan one. Without it `ADAPTERS` would register it under
#: `(Bailey, motorhome)` and it would silently replace `bailey.py`.
VEHICLE_CLASS = VehicleClass.CARAVAN

#: The index listing every current model, across all ranges. Bailey have a per-range page
#: too, but this one page links all 23 models, so a full sweep is one fetch rather than
#: five. Note `/caravans/` — the URL a person would guess — returns an `image/png` with a
#: 200 status; `/touring-caravans/` is the real section root.
MODELS_INDEX_PATH = "current-caravan-models"

#: (range path segment, label) for `--range`. The label is what a reviewer picks; the real
#: `manufacturer_range` is read from each page's own `Range` field.

)

#: A range whose literal `Range` field abbreviates the real name — see the module
#: docstring. `Unicorn Deluxe`, `Alicanto Grande Deluxe` and `Discovery` need no entry:

#: Bailey's own `Axle` value, lower-cased, that means two axles. Anything else — `Single`,
#: or a value nobody has seen yet — leaves `twin_axle` False, which is also the FMLV
#: default, so an unrecognised value understates rather than inventing a second axle.
_TWIN_AXLE_VALUE = "twin"

#: Awning size is the one dimension Bailey give in centimetres rather than metres
#: (`1089.1cm`), and to a tenth of a centimetre. 1089.1cm -> 10891mm exactly, which is the
#: figure FMLV already holds for that product.
_CENTIMETRES = re.compile(r"([\d.]+)\s*cm")

#: `'£34,499'` -> `34499`. Read from the spec table's own `RRP Price` row, unlike
#: `bailey.py`, which has to use the hero banner because both price rows are
#: HTML-commented out on motorhome and campervan pages. On caravan pages `RRP Price` is
#: live and `OTR Price` is the empty one — the reverse of the motorhome template.
_PRICE = re.compile(r"£\s*([\d,]+)")

#: One model page URL, scoped to a range so a link elsewhere on the page is never picked
#: up. Anchored on the `/touring-caravans/<range>/<slug>/` shape, which also excludes the
