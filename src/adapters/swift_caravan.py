"""Swift (swiftgroup.co.uk) — touring caravans, from the range pages' own JSON.

The sibling of `swift.py`, and a separate module rather than a flag on it: FMLV keeps
motorhomes and touring caravans as separate exports with separate schemas, so this one
produces `Caravan`s and registers under `("Swift Group Ltd", caravan)`. See the caravan
section of `docs/adapters/swift.md` for the survey this was built from.

**Built on `swift.py`, not on `bailey_caravan.py`.** Bailey's caravans are one page per
vehicle with a literal spec table; Swift's are the same shape as Swift's motorhomes —
one page per *range*, carrying a `<script type="application/json"
data-product-layouts-data>` block with one object per layout. Every parsing helper is
imported from the motorhome module unchanged, `range_and_model` included:

    {"id":1479,"title":"Sprite Alpine 4","code":"sprite-alpine-4",
     "priceLabel":"From \\u00A322,585","berths":"4 berths",
     "axleType":"Caravan - Single axle","length":"6.45m","width":"2.23m",
     "weightMtplm":"1247kg","weightMro":"1102kg",
     "optionalWeightPlateUpgrade":"1300kg", ...}

Seven range pages, 26 layouts: Sprite (4), Sprite Grande (1), Challenger (6), Challenger
Grande (4), Conqueror (3), Conqueror Grande (4), Elegance Grande (4). The same
brochure-retirement trap applies as for the motorhomes and for the same reason —
`2026_swift_caravan_brochure.pdf` is still live and still linked from `/brochures/`, so
nothing here searches that directory and the guide pattern is anchored on `quick-guide`.

**`length` IS THE SHIPPING LENGTH.** This is the single most consequential thing the
survey established, and it is not inferable from the site: Swift publish one length and
never say which of the four it is. Two independent sources settle it. The 2026 brochure's
"Specification at a glance" table labels its columns, and gives the Alpine 4 an *Internal
Length* of 4.74m against an *Overall Length* of 6.45m; FMLV holds that product as
`internal_length_mm=4740, shipping_length_mm=6450`. The site's `6.45m` is the overall
figure, so it maps to `shipping_length_mm` and to nothing else. Mapping it to
`internal_length_mm` would overstate every caravan's habitable space by 1.5-1.7m while
looking entirely plausible on any one product — `docs/adapters/README.md` names this as
the most likely single way to get a caravan adapter wrong.

**Range names need no corrections, which was checked rather than assumed.** FMLV's own
export already holds `Sprite`, `Challenger`, `Challenger Grande`, `Conqueror`,
`Conqueror Grande` and `Elegance Grande` exactly as the site's range pages divide them,
`Conqueror Grande` + `560L` included; `Sprite Grande` is in the export from an earlier
model year, so the 2027 Quattro FB joins a range FMLV already knows. Contrast the
brochure, which files every Grande as a *model* under its parent range ("Challenger /
Grande 580") — following the printed document instead of the site would have proposed
nine renames FMLV does not want.

**Three fields Swift published in the brochure and no longer publish at all**, so none
of the three is emitted and all three are narrated once per run instead. FMLV holds good
figures for every one of them on the 24 carried-over products, and per
`docs/adapters/README.md` a figure that could not be found must be left alone rather than
guessed at or back-filled from last season's document — the same call `swift.py` makes
for motorhome heights, and for the same reason.

* `internal_length_mm` — brochure only. Not to be confused with
  `exterior_body_length_mm`, which is out of automated scope globally.
* `height_mm` — brochure only (2.59m/2.61m).
* `awning_length_mm` — brochure's "Awning A/A Dimension" only.

`personal_effects_payload_kilograms` was a fourth until 4 September 2026, on the same
reasoning. The requester overruled it: two published masses determine the payload, so
withholding it left a reviewer looking at a blank beside the figures that fill it. See
below.

**Payload is derived as `MTPLM - MRO`**, the same arithmetic and the same wording
`swift.py` uses for `mh_payload_kilograms` — the requester's instruction, 4 September
2026, on seeing the field arrive blank beside two masses that determine it. It is
corroborated rather than merely computed: the quick guide's `Max Payload` matches the
subtraction on all 26, so the provenance quotes the guide where it has an entry and says
so plainly where it does not.

**And where FMLV holds a split, the adapter asks for it to be cleared.** FMLV has *two*
payload columns and expects them to sum to `MTPLM - MRO`. On the four Elegance Grandes it
uses both: `personal_effects` 160kg plus `optional_equipment` 41kg makes the 201kg the
guide prints. Since the derived total goes into the personal-effects column, leaving that
41kg in place would make the row read 242kg against 201kg of real capacity.

The requester's rule (4 September 2026) settles it: *where a model previously had a split
and no longer does, take the one published figure and use it as the personal-effects
total.* So this adapter records provenance for `optional_equipment_payload_kilograms`
with **no value** — saying "Swift publish no such figure" — which `diff.compare` turns
into a confirm-or-clear row wherever the baseline holds one. The reviewer clears it with
the "Leave blank" action, and the two columns then sum to the published total.

It is asked for rather than done silently, deliberately: `diff.compare` routes a
value-to-nothing change down the confirm-or-replace path precisely so no field is emptied
by an "accept". On the other 22 products FMLV already holds it blank, so the field comes
back confirmed and no row appears. `validation._validate_caravan_payload` is the backstop
either way — it compares the two figures and warns on the generated CSV, naming any
product where they still disagree.

Note the split contradicts `docs/adapters/README.md`'s "blank on all 92 real caravan
products", which was true of Bailey and Adria and is not true of Swift.

**The self-check is cross-document and came out an exact bijection.** The JSON publishes
MTPLM and MRO but no payload; the quick guide publishes payload, length, width and MTPLM
but no MRO. So `payload == MTPLM - MRO` is a real check across two documents rather than
an arithmetic tautology, and the guide's length and width corroborate the site's on top of
it. On 2026-09-03: 26 guide blocks, 26 site products, every one agreeing on all three
figures, none left over.

Entries are keyed on **MTPLM, not on the model name**, because Swift's two documents
disagree about names — the guide calls the Elegance layouts `Grande 850 L` and
`Grande 860 L` where both the site and FMLV call them `850` and `860`, and it prefixes
`Grande ` to every model the site leaves bare. MTPLM is published identically by both and
is near-unique: the only repeat across all 26 is 1886kg, shared by Conqueror Grande 645
and 650L, which carry the same payload as each other anyway.

**Two axle corrections are expected on the first run, and they are this adapter working.**
FMLV holds Challenger Grande 580 and Conqueror Grande 580 as twin-axle. Swift's 2027 JSON
says `Caravan - Single axle` for both; the 2027 guide's per-range counts agree (Challenger
7 single / 3 twin, Conqueror 5 single / 2 twin, which only balances if those two are
single); and the 2026 brochure's "Number of Axles" column already said 1. Three Swift
sources against one FMLV field.

**`optionalWeightPlateUpgrade` is not the MTPLM.** Every layout carries one — 1300kg
against the Alpine 4's 1247kg MTPLM — and it is an optional dealer upgrade. Per
`docs/adapters/README.md` the base figure is the one to record, so this field is read by
nothing here. It is named in the docstring and covered by a test because it sits
immediately beside `weightMtplm` in the same object and is the obvious wrong pick.

**Everything is rigid.** Swift's 2027 caravans are all rigid: no folding or pop-up, and no
micro. The micro trap is live rather than theoretical — Challenger 390's MTPLM is 1118kg,
below the 1250kg threshold — but the rule needs the manufacturer's own naming *as well as*
the weight, and Swift market nothing as a micro. Their one genuinely small vehicle,
Basecamp (1043kg), was held by FMLV as rigid too and is discontinued for 2027, so it will
be reported as disappeared.

As in `bailey_caravan.py`, the provenance gives the **general** rule rather than a claim
about this brand's current range: a caravan is rigid unless its *walls* fold or rise, so a
lifting roof does not change the type even where the manufacturer calls it a pop-up (NCC,
7 September 2026 — see `docs/adapters/README.md`).

**Headroom is scraped, not assumed.** Every range page states `1.95m (6'5") headroom` in
its own highlights, and FMLV holds 1950mm on all 26. It is read off each page rather than
hard-coded so that a range which changes it, or a page which stops saying it, comes out
narrated instead of silently wrong.
