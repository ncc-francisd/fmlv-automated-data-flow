"""Moto-Trek (moto-trek.co.uk) — the fourteenth adapter, campervans and coachbuilts.

See `docs/adapters/moto-trek.md` for the full write-up. Plain server-rendered
WordPress/Elementor, no JavaScript, and **one URL is one vehicle** — so like Bailey there
is no column to misalign in the usual sense. The risk here is a different one, and it is
worse, because the spec table is not a table at all:

    container 288a948                     <- the "Vehicle Specification" accordion panel
      container b284b60                   <- LABELS: n text-editor widgets
        "Berths" "Engine Size" "Overall Length" ... "Overall Height (Inc. Aerial)*"
      container 9b3642f                   <- VALUES: m text-editor widgets, m <= n
        "2" "2.0L 140BHP" "6.36m / 20’10”" ... "3500kg"

**Two parallel columns with no row element and nothing pairing them but position.** Label
*i* means value *i* and that is the only join. The columns are different lengths on every
page, because Dynamic Content for Elementor drops an empty widget rather than rendering it
blank — 15/13 on the Leisure-Treka EB, 12/10 on the ELD, 9/7 on the X-Cite, 5/5 on the
Pioneer. It drops the label *and* its value together for every field it controls, so the
surviving pairs stay in step; the label set itself therefore varies per model, and only the
ELD publishes `M.I.R.O` / `M.T.P.L.M` / `Maximum User Payload` at all.

**Only two labels are ever empty, which is what makes the alignment checkable.**
`Overall Width (Mirrors Folded)*` and `Overall Height (Inc. Aerial)*` appear on twelve of
the thirteen vehicle pages and are empty on all twelve; the Pioneer, which publishes no
width or height at all, carries neither. So the surplus is a **subset** of
`_ALWAYS_EMPTY_LABELS` (`surplus_is_expected`) rather than equal to it — requiring equality
silently dropped the Pioneer while this adapter was being written, which is the check's own
failure mode pointed the wrong way. What it really asserts is that no *data-bearing* label
runs past the end of the value column.

It also means the asterisked figures are already the base-vehicle ones. The ELD's own
handbook decodes the asterisk, which the site never does: "2.26m wide **with the mirrors
folded** / 2.64m tall **with the TV aerial stowed**".

**A real error on their site, and the arithmetic that proves the pairing is right.** The
Leisure-Treka ELD reads `Garage Length = 3160kg`. That looks exactly like a one-place shift,
but `3500 - 3160 = 340` holds as printed and any shift breaks it, and the value widget id
carrying it (`6aa2ced`) holds `2.59m` on the EB page. So Moto-Trek have typed the M.I.R.O
into their own Garage Length field. `SpecBlock.mismatches` catches it — a `Length` label
whose value is `kg` is not a length — and because it is *one* mismatch on an out-of-scope
field it is narrated and the product kept. **More than one mismatch drops the product**, on
the reasoning that a genuine column shift would break several pairs at once while a typo
breaks one. This is the check that covers a value missing from the *middle* of the column,
which the surplus check cannot see.

**Identity comes from a table, not from the page.** Moto-Trek's names do not mechanically
yield FMLV's `manufacturer_range` + `model` split: the Pioneer's page is titled just
"Pioneer" and never mentions the `IB` layout FMLV holds, "X-Cite EB Elite" has to lose its
trim to become `X-Cite` + `EB`, and `The Terrain` and `Tornado` repeat the range in the
model. See `VEHICLE_IDENTITIES`, which is checked against the real export.

**Two vehicles in the roster are deliberately not collected** — see `IGNORED_SLUGS`. One of
them, Cyclone 180S, is a braked trailer. The other, the Ford Custom Campervan, is branded
*Three Peaks* and is a separate NCC supplier with its own baseline, and its page carries no
spec block at all. The Tornado Transporter is filed under *Motorsport* and **is** collected,
because FMLV holds it as a current product; note its spec block is byte-identical to the
Leisure-Treka EB's except for berths, which `collect` narrates.

**Price is the website's headline figure**, `from £72495.00`, which is ex works plus VAT.
Moto-Trek's two withdrawn 2024 price lists (hidden in the media library, in no page and no
sitemap) restate identical net prices as an on-the-road `GRAND TOTAL`, +£400 flat. The rule
is to record the headline a buyer sees, so that FMLV and moto-trek.co.uk agree — requester,
27 August 2026. `POA` is not a price and never becomes zero.

Four vehicles are `POA`, and for those the run **narrates** the last figure Moto-Trek did
publish, with its date, from `LAST_PUBLISHED_PRICES` — so a reviewer entering a guide price
by hand has the manufacturer's own number rather than an estimate. It is never written to
`rrp_pounds`; asserting a withdrawn figure as collected is a different thing from a reviewer
choosing it knowingly.

**Seats are unpublished everywhere on this manufacturer** — the vehicle pages, the index
cards and the ELD handbook all decline to give a number — so `mh_passenger_seats_inc_driver`
is always left unset and narrated once per run.

#: The complete leisure roster, and the only place the FMLV identity split is decided.
#:
#: Keyed by the site's own `/vehicle/<slug>/` slug. Values are `(manufacturer_range, model,
#: is_campervan)` exactly as the real export holds them — verified against
#: `Moto-Trek`'s export on 27 August 2026, where emitting these gives a 1.000 match on all
#: ten current products, so no rename is ever proposed.
#:
#: Three entries cannot be derived from the page and are the reason this table exists:
#:
#: * `pioneer` — the page is titled "Pioneer" and names no layout; FMLV holds model `IB`.
#: * `x-cite-*-elite` — "Elite" is a trim, not part of the model. FMLV holds `EB` and `G`.
#: * `the-terrain` and `tornado-transporter` — FMLV repeats the range in the model, which the
#:   product slug `moto-trek-the-terrain-the-terrain-peugeot` confirms is deliberate.
#:
#: `is_campervan` is the shape judgement, taken as declared per `docs/adapters/README.md`.
#: Every Leisure-Treka, the Terrain and the Tornado are Peugeot Boxer van conversions; the
#: Xploras, X-Cites, Euro-Treka and Pioneer are coachbuilts, and return no body type because
#: the site never says whether they are low-profile or over-cab.
#:
#: **The ELD is a van conversion too, and an earlier version of this table had it wrong.**
#: It looks like a coachbuilt sitting between its siblings — 2.26m wide against their 2.05m,
#: 2.64m tall against their 2.76m, and a 3160kg mass against their 2500kg. All three are
#: measurement conventions, not a different vehicle:
#:
#: * its own handbook says "2.26m wide **with the mirrors folded**", and 2260 − 2050 = 210mm
#:   is about 105mm per mirror, exactly what a folded van mirror adds;
#: * the same handbook says "2.64m tall **with the TV aerial stowed**", so the 120mm is an
#:   aerial;
#: * and the masses are different measurements — the siblings publish `Unladen Weight`,
#:   the ELD `M.I.R.O`, which its handbook defines as *including* habitation equipment, a
#:   90% gas tank, a full 70L of water and the hook-up cable.
#:
#: All four are 6.36m long on the same Boxer. FMLV holds it as `campervan_high_top` and that
#: is right — the requester queried the proposed correction and it did not survive.

    ),
}

#: The last price Moto-Trek published for each vehicle the site now marks `POA`, with the
#: date of the document it came from. `(pounds, document date)`.
#:
#: **Narrated only — never written to `rrp_pounds`.** A run must not assert a withdrawn
#: figure as though it had collected one, and the price rule is to record the manufacturer's
#: *headline website* price, which for these four does not exist. What this does is put the
#: number in front of the reviewer on the run page, so entering a guide price by hand is a
#: sourced decision rather than an estimate (requester, 27 August 2026).
#:
#: The figures are the `2024 Retail Price` column of `January-2024-Retail-Price-List.pdf` —
#: net plus VAT, which is the basis FMLV already holds. The October 2024 guide restates the
#: identical net prices on an on-the-road basis (+£400 flat: £153,215, £98,395 and £70,395),
#: and is deliberately not used, per the headline-price rule.
#:
#: **Two model years old, but not obviously stale:** all seven prices the site *still*
#: publishes are identical to this same list, to the pound — Moto-Trek have not moved a
#: published price since January 2024. Re-check when a newer list appears in the media
#: library (`/wp-json/wp/v2/media?mime_type=application/pdf`), which is where these hide.
#:
#: **All three now agree with FMLV**, which is the narration having done its job: the
#: requester corrected the Tornado in Nova on 27 August 2026 from £64,995 — a figure older
#: than anything on the site — to the £69,995 below, and the out-of-scope Three Peaks Ford
#: Camper from £63,995 to its own £75,995. So these entries are no longer flagging a
#: discrepancy; they exist for the Euro-Treka IB, which has no FMLV price at all until it is
#: uploaded, and to keep a figure in front of a reviewer if the site's `POA` ever outlives
#: what FMLV holds.

#: `(informational slug, label)`. The label is the FMLV `manufacturer_range`, so
#: `cli.baseline_scope`'s default match on that column is correct and no
#: `baseline_in_scope` hook is needed. The first element is *not* a fetch path: Moto-Trek's
#: own range index pages (`/leisure-treka/`, `/xplora/`, `/slideouts/`) cut across FMLV's
#: ranges — `/slideouts/` alone holds X-Cite, Euro-Treka, Pioneer and the Terrain — so the
#: selector filters the roster instead of choosing a URL.

#:
#: **Twelve of the thirteen vehicle pages carry both, empty.** The Pioneer carries neither —
#: it publishes no width or height at all, and DCE drops these two along with
#: `Overall Width*` and `Overall Height*`. So the surplus is a *subset* of this tuple, not
#: always equal to it: an earlier version of this adapter required equality and silently
#: dropped the Pioneer, which is exactly the failure the check exists to prevent, pointed
#: the wrong way.
#:
#: The check still bites, because what it really asserts is that **no data-bearing label
#: runs past the value column** — the signature of the two columns having come out of step.
#: A value missing from the *middle* of the column slips past it untouched, which is what

#: `kind` is the type check, and it is applied to **every** pair including the out-of-scope

#: whole column, which is worth more than the garage dimension itself.
#:
#: The two mass labels are duplicated because the vocabulary is not consistent between
