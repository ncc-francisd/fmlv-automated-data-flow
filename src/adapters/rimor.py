"""Rimor — UK range and prices from the importer, specifications from the factory.

See `docs/adapters/rimor.md` for the full write-up. Rimor is the first adapter to read
two *different* sites and let each decide different fields, because neither one can
answer the whole question:

* **Motorhomes & Caravans Ltd (`motorhomesandcaravansltd.co.uk`) decides which products
  exist and what they cost.** Rimor is sold in the UK exclusively through MNC, so the UK
  range *is* whatever MNC lists — the factory's own catalogue carries layouts that are
  never imported. And Rimor publishes no price anywhere in the world, so MNC's is the
  only price there is.
* **`rimor.it` decides every number.** MNC's specifications are a sales description, not
  a data sheet: it truncates dimensions to whole centimetres, it repeats the travel-seat
  count in place of the berth count on the coachbuilts, and at least two of its layouts
  carry another layout's figures. The factory publishes exact millimetres, the
  homologated seat count, the standard berth count, MTPLM, MRO and the bedding solution.

So MNC is walked for the range, the price and the body type, and each listing is then
joined to its factory layout page, which supplies the specification. A layout MNC does
not list is not a UK product and is not emitted, however complete its factory page.

    MNC   /product-category/new-motorhomes-for-sale/new-rimor-motorhomes/<range>
            -> /product/rimor-<range>-<layout>-<year>[-variant]    price, body type
    Rimor /int/en/gamma/<range>/<body-style>
            -> /int/en/gamma/<range>/modello/<layout>              every specification

Three things shape this adapter:

* **The join survives Rimor's renaming.** Rimor moved its whole Kilig low-profile line
  to `<n> Plus` for the new season while MNC still lists the old names, so a layout is
  looked up with a `-plus` fallback — MNC's `kilig-66` finds `kilig/66-plus`.
  `_factory_slug` is where that lives, and the dimension check below is what *proves*
  the match rather than assuming it.
* **The self-check is cross-site.** MNC and Rimor publish each layout's dimensions
  independently, so the two are compared. MNC truncates metres, which caps an honest
  disagreement at 9 mm; anything larger is a real conflict, narrated loudly, with the
  factory figure kept. It is what caught Kilig 79 (MNC prints the 78's length) and
  Kilig 99 (out by 132 mm).
* **Stock units are not products.** MNC sells actual vehicles alongside its layout
  listings — demo vans with a struck-through price, and WordPress `-copy` slugs. Each
  layout is emitted once, preferring its plain listing; where a demo unit is the only
  listing a layout has, the *pre-discount* price is taken, because the discount belongs
  to that one vehicle and not to the layout. See `select_listings` and `price_from`.

SLUG_RANGES: tuple[str, ...] = ("super-brig", "horus", "kilig", "sarus", "sailer", "van")

#: The range each slug prefix names. `van` is deliberately mapped to Horus: MNC files the
