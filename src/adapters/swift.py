"""Swift (swiftgroup.co.uk) — motorhomes and campervans, from the range pages' own JSON.

See `docs/adapters/swift.md` for the full write-up.

**Rewritten 2026-08-28, because Swift retired the full brochure.** The first version of
this adapter read the "Specification at a glance" table out of the annual brochure PDFs.
For 2027 there is no full brochure: motorhomes, campervans and caravans all got a
two-page *quick guide* instead, and the detailed per-layout data moved onto the website.
The old brochure is still downloadable and still linked from `/brochures/`, which is the
trap here — a URL pattern loosened to match `2027-swift-motorhome-quick-guide.pdf`
would just as happily match `2026_swift_motorhome_brochure.pdf` and propose last
season's range as current. That is why this reads the site, not a PDF, and why nothing
here searches `/brochures/`.

**Where the data is now.** Each range has one page, `/{motorhomes,campervans}/product/
<id>/<slug>/`, carrying a `<script type="application/json" data-product-layouts-data>`
block with one object per layout — plain server-rendered HTML, so still no JavaScript:

    {"id":75041,"title":"Kon-Tiki 774","code":"kon-tiki-774","badge":"New for 2027",
     "priceLabel":"From \\u00A3114,395 OTR","berths":"6 berths",
     "travellingSeats":"5 travelling seats","licenceCategory":"C1","length":"8.22m",
     "width":"2.39m","weightMtplm":"4500kg","weightMro":"3638kg", ...}

This is better than the brochure it replaces in two ways and worse in one:

* **Price, on every layout.** The 2026 survey recorded that Swift published no price
  anywhere; for 2027 all 39 carry a `From £x OTR` figure, which is exactly the basis
  `docs/adapters/README.md` says FMLV records.
* **Range attribution is free**, and that matters more here than anywhere else — see
  the Trekker note below.
* **No height.** Neither the JSON nor the quick guide publishes one, so
  `mh_height_mm` is never emitted. It is left to arrive as a `MissingField`, which
  shows a reviewer the baseline figure alongside "nothing scraped" and leaves the
  stored value alone. Carrying the 2026 brochure's number forward *as a proposal* was
  considered and rejected: FMLV already holds heights that disagree with it on the
  Kon-Tikis (2890 against the brochure's 2880), so proposing it would rewrite good
  data with older data on no 2027 evidence at all.

**TREKKER IS TWO DIFFERENT RANGES**, one motorhome and one campervan — the same
collision as Auto-Trail's Expedition, and the requester flagged it independently. FMLV
already models it: the coachbuilts are range `Trekker 500` (models 540, 584, 594) and
the vans are range `Trekker` (models X, XF). So the motorhome range is renamed via
`RANGE_NAME_CORRECTIONS` and the range a layout belongs to comes from *which index page
led to its page*, never from its name.

It is worse than a name clash. The layout numbers collide too, with **identical length
and MTPLM**: Voyager 505 and Trekker 505 are both 6.19m at 3500kg, and 540, 584 and 594
are shared as well. Only MRO separates them (2837 against 2885). Nothing here may ever
key a layout on its number alone.

**The self-check is cross-document.** The JSON publishes MRO but no payload; the quick
guide publishes payload but no MRO. So `payload == MTPLM - MRO` can be checked across
the two, which is a real check rather than an arithmetic tautology. On 2026-08-28 it was
an exact bijection: 39 payload figures in the guides, 39 products on the site, all
reconciling, none left over.

The guide prints those figures two ways, and both are read (see `parse_guide_payloads`):
a full block per floorplan, and a compact `244 Max Payload / 470kg` line for a variant
that shares its sibling's floorplan and differs only in weight.

**One deliberate softness.** A layout is dropped when the guide contradicts it, but only
*warned* about when the guide has nothing to say. The brochure version dropped hard
because its two tables were joined on `(range, layout)` and a misjoin was the failure
being defended against. There is no join here — one JSON object is one vehicle — so
column misalignment is structurally impossible, and the remaining risk is Swift
mis-stating a figure. Losing a real vehicle over a gap in a marketing leaflet's coverage
would be the worse error.

#: (index page path, category label). Both are ordinary server-rendered pages listing
#: one link per model range. Campervans are included on the same basis as Adria's and
#: as the brochure version's: FMLV treats them as motorhomes and the export's Swift
#: rows cover both.
DEFAULT_RANGES: tuple[tuple[str, str], ...] = (
    ("motorhomes", "Motorhomes"),
    ("campervans", "Campervans"),
)

#: Where the site's range name differs from the one FMLV holds, keyed on
#: `(index path, range name as the site writes it)`.
#:
#: Only one entry, and it is the important one. Swift sells a `Trekker` coachbuilt range
#: *and* a `Trekker` campervan range. FMLV distinguishes them as `Trekker 500` and
#: `Trekker`, which the baseline export confirms (range `Trekker 500` holds 540/584/594,
#: range `Trekker` holds S/X/XF/XL). Emitting the site's bare "Trekker" for both would
#: merge two unrelated ranges — the mistake Auto-Trail's `expedition-coachbuilt` vs
#: `expedition-van` keys exist to prevent.
RANGE_NAME_CORRECTIONS: dict[tuple[str, str], str] = {
    ("motorhomes", "Trekker"): "Trekker 500",
}

#: The range pages linked from one index page, e.g.
#: `/motorhomes/product/42117/swift-kon-tiki/`. The numeric id is Swift's CMS node id
#: and the slug is not derivable from the range name (`swift-kon-tiki`, but plain
#: `merlin`), so these are always rediscovered per run rather than constructed.
#:
#: **The category must be interpolated, not alternated.** Swift's nav block is global and
#: repeated on every page, so the motorhomes index links every campervan range too. A
#: pattern accepting either category reads all nine ranges twice — once per index — and
#: applies the motorhome `Trekker` -> `Trekker 500` correction to the campervan Trekker
#: on the first pass. That is the same global-nav trap `chausson.py` hit.
_RANGE_PAGE_HREF_TEMPLATE = r'href="(/{category}/product/\d+/[^"#?]+/)"'

#: The layout data block. Anchored on the `data-product-layouts-data` attribute rather
#: than on a bare `[{"id"`, because the attribute is what actually names this block: it
#: is how Swift's own `/scripts/product-layouts-new.js` finds it. On 2026-08-28 the array
#: appeared exactly once on the page, so a looser pattern would have worked too — but it
#: would be matching a JSON shape rather than an identified element, and Swift adds
#: further JSON blocks to these pages (`optionalExtras`, image manifests) as they go.
_LAYOUTS_JSON = re.compile(
    r'<script[^>]*\bdata-product-layouts-data\b[^>]*>\s*(\[.*?\])\s*</script>',
    re.DOTALL,
)

#: The quick guide linked from an index page, e.g.
#: `/media/0yxdkzhv/2027-swift-motorhome-quick-guide.pdf`. Read only for the payload
#: self-check, never for product data.
#:
#: **Deliberately anchored on `quick-guide`, not on `.pdf`.** The `/media/` directory
#: segment is an opaque key that changes on re-upload, so the filename is all there is
#: to match on, and matching it loosely is how a run would end up parsing the still-live
#: `2026_swift_motorhome_brochure.pdf`.
_QUICK_GUIDE_HREF = re.compile(r'href="(/media/[^"]+-quick-guide\.pdf)"', re.IGNORECASE)

#: The base vehicle, stated once per range page in the "Exterior & Construction" list:
#: `Ford Transit Skeletal chassis cab in Magnetic Grey`, `Fiat chassis cab in New
#: Expedition Grey`, `Fiat Ducato panel van with body coloured grille`.
#:
#: **The make and the body phrase have to be matched together.** The Carrera page's
#: `<title>` is "Award-winning Swift Carrera panel van, refreshed for 2026", so anchoring
#: on `panel van` alone finds a heading with no make in it. Up to two words are allowed
#: between the two so that `Transit`, `Ducato` and `Transit Skeletal` all pass.
#:
#: Confirmed against the real export: reading this on all seven live ranges reproduces
#: FMLV's own split exactly — Ford 17 (Voyager 9, Trekker 500 3, Trekker 4, Monza 1) and
#: Fiat 14 (Escape 4, Kon-Tiki 4, Carrera 6) across all 31 baseline products.

_MARKUP = re.compile(r"<script.*?</script>|<style.*?</style>|<[^>]+>", re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE)

#: Overall height in mm for the Merlin, keyed on model. **Not scraped — nothing Swift
#: publishes for 2027 carries a height** (see the module docstring), so these come from a
#: pre-launch specification sheet Swift sent the requester in late July 2026, passed on
#: 2026-08-28. That sheet carries range, base vehicle and height and *no prices or
#: weights*, so it is useful for this one field and nothing else; everything else still
#: comes from the site, which by now has both.
#:
#: Recorded here rather than left blank because these are all **new products with no
#: baseline** — the flagged-no-op route that preserves a height for the other 30 has
#: nothing to preserve for a Merlin, so without this they would stay empty on every run.
#: Same pattern, and the same caveat, as `auto_trail._MANUALLY_SOURCED_MTPLM_KG`: it
#: CANNOT refresh itself, it is narrated on every run, and it must be re-verified at each
#: model-year changeover or as soon as Swift publish heights again.
#:
#: The five 2720s and four 2790s split exactly on the elevating roof, which the Merlin
#: page lists as standard equipment on `212, 244, 264 & 274` only — 70mm of roof
#: hardware. The Carrera corroborates it independently: same Fiat Ducato panel van, same
#: 2260mm width, 2720mm on its five plain models and 2790mm on the 244, which is the one
#: model its own page gives an elevating roof.
#:
#: **112, 122 and 212 are absent deliberately.** They were not on the extract supplied,
#: and the pattern above predicts 2720/2720/2790 for them — but a predicted height is not
#: a published one, so they are left blank and narrated instead of guessed.

#: A coachbuilt range's roof profile, from the range page's own construction list. Every
#: 2027 motorhome range states it: `GRP front low line pod` on the Voyager and Trekker
#: 500, `AL-KO low line chassis conversion` on the Escape and Kon-Tiki.
#:
#: **Matched rather than assumed** so that an A-class or an over-cab range added later
#: comes out unset and narrated instead of silently mislabelled `low profile`.
_LOW_PROFILE = re.compile(r"\blow[ -]line\b", re.IGNORECASE)

#: **`over-cab` on a Swift page does NOT mean an over-cab bed.** Both ranges that use the
#: phrase mean *storage*: "Zip pocket storage on the overcab side lockers" (Trekker 500),
#: "Moulded over-cab storage compartments with Skyview opening sunroof" (Kon-Tiki). Those
#: are lockers in the low-profile pod. Swift's extra berths come from a **drop-down bed
#: over the front lounge**, which is a low-profile feature, not a Luton.
#:
#: Kept only to make the distinction explicit and testable: a keyword search for
#: "over cab" would classify two low-profile ranges as `COACH_BUILT_OVER_CAB_BED`.
_OVER_CAB_BED = re.compile(r"over[ -]?cab\s+(?:double|bed|island)", re.IGNORECASE)

#: The models an elevating roof is standard on, from the campervan range pages:
#: `Elevating roof in Black with Mini-Heki skylight (212, 244, 264 & 274)`,
#: `Elevating roof in body colour (Trekker X)`, `Elevating roof ... (244 only)`.
#:
#: It appears in **no** `optionalExtras` list on any of the 39 products, so where it is
#: named it is standard fitment restricted by model — which per `docs/adapters/README.md`
#: is what decides the elevating half of the campervan 2x2.
_ELEVATING_ROOF = re.compile(r"Elevating roof[^(]{0,80}\(([^)]{1,80})\)", re.IGNORECASE)

#: A model name inside that parenthetical: `212, 244, 264 & 274`, `Trekker X`, `244 only`.
_ELEVATING_ROOF_MODEL = re.compile(r"(?:Trekker\s+)?([A-Z]{1,2}\b|\d{3})")

#: A campervan taller than this is a high top. The same shared threshold as
#: `auto_trail.HIGH_TOP_ABOVE_MM`, set by the NCC side on 16 August 2026: FMLV's tallest
#: standard-height campervan is 2050mm, so 2300mm clears every known standard roof.
#:
#: **Not 2680.** That figure appears in `docs/adapters/README.md` as a description of what
#: an extended high top characteristically measures, not as the cut-off, and the README
#: warns against the confusion in as many words — Elddis's 2610mm Boxer "**is** a high top,
#: so the shared `HIGH_TOP_ABOVE_MM = 2300` needed no adjustment". This adapter used 2680
#: briefly on 2026-08-29 and it was wrong. It changed no Swift result (the Merlin is
#: 2720/2790, above both) but it would have called a standard-roof van a plain campervan.
HIGH_TOP_ABOVE_MM = 2300

#: payload and MTPLM may carry footnote marks (`663kg*`, `3500kg**`) and may hold *two*
#: figures for the two weight plates a floorplan is sold on (`270kg | 400kg` against
#: `3500kg | 3700kg`), which is how the guide encodes what the site sells as separate
#: 2-berth and 4-berth products. The pairs are positional.

#: A variant that shares its sibling's floorplan and is printed as nothing but a payload:
