"""The adapter interface: one module per manufacturer, snapshot in, `Motorhome`s out.

Per DESIGN.md §5.1, `adapters/` is "the only manufacturer-specific code" — everything
else in the pipeline (fetching, the canonical model, diffing, review) is generic.

Fetching and parsing are deliberately *not* split into separate interface methods.
For a JS-driven catalogue (Adria's is the first one surveyed — see `adria.py`),
discovering what to fetch next depends on content already fetched: the technical-data
PDF for one product is only reachable once its ID has been read out of an earlier
AJAX response. An adapter therefore owns its whole fetch-then-parse sequence, but
every request still goes through `Fetcher`/`BrowserFetcher`, so every request is still
snapshotted to disk regardless (DESIGN.md §6.6) and reproducible.

#: Every spelling a manufacturer's own site or document has been seen to use for a base
#: vehicle, mapped to the one string FMLV holds. Keyed on the lower-cased make so a
#: `.title()`-ed CSS class, an all-caps PDF heading and a full legal name all land on the
#: same value.
#:
#: **The naming protocol, from the requester, 27 August 2026.** Where one company is both a
#: base-vehicle supplier *and* a manufacturer of complete leisure vehicles, FMLV gives the
#: two roles **deliberately different names**: the abbreviated form is the base vehicle, the
#: full form is the manufacturer.
#:
#: | Company | Base vehicle | Manufacturer |
#: |---|---|---|
#: | Volkswagen | **`VW`** | `Volkswagen` |
#: | Mercedes-Benz | **`Mercedes`** | `Mercedes-Benz` |
#:
#: The reason is the customer-facing filters: "what we don't want is customers to be
#: confused whether to choose in the filters VW or Volkswagen. It should only be one base
#: vehicle name for that company who makes base vehicles, and only one name for the
#: manufacturer who actually makes entire vehicles." Volkswagen build campervans themselves,
#: so both roles are real and both are populated.
#:
#: **So `VW` here is correct and must not be "corrected" to `Volkswagen`.** The trap is that
#: the base-vehicle column of every export this project holds shows only eight spellings and
#: **`VW` is not among them** — Fiat 740, Mercedes 187, Ford 171, Peugeot 157, IVECO 142,
#: MAN 21, Citroën 19, Renault 5. That is a gap in our sample, not a fact about FMLV: none of
#: the fourteen manufacturers surveyed so far builds on a Crafter until Sunlight's VW IBEX.
#: FMLV holds **over a hundred** VW base vehicles. Reasoning from the exports alone very
#: nearly produced a wrong "correction" here, which is the roster lesson in
#: `docs/adapters/README.md` turned on FMLV's own data — an absence you cannot explain is a
#: gap in the search.
#:
#: One further rule:
#:
#: * **`Citroën` with the diaeresis, always** — for Chausson and every other brand.
#:   Chausson reads its make from a CSS class (`porteur picto citroen`), which cannot
#:   carry the accent, so without this the accent could never be recovered.

    adapter routes its make through here so that decision is made in one place instead of
    thirteen — see `docs/adapters/README.md`.

    An unrecognised make is returned **unchanged rather than blanked**: it is far more
    likely to be a real chassis nobody has met yet than a parse error, and dropping it
    would lose a REQUIRED field. `tests/adapters/test_registry_wiring.py` is what stops a
    known-wrong spelling reaching a reviewer.

    Normalising here, on the adapter side only, is deliberate. Doing it on `Motorhome`
    itself would also rewrite the value read *out of* the FMLV baseline, so a row FMLV
    holds as `Citroen` would silently match `Citroën` and the correction would never be

    second CLIFF is noise: the range has already said it.

    Only ever drops a *leading* word, only when the range genuinely contains that word,

    so `CLIFF X` + `CLIFF` keeps `CLIFF`, since the alternative is a product with no
