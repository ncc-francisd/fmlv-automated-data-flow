"""Adria Mobil (UK importer site, adria.co.uk) — the first adapter.

See `docs/adapters/adria.md` for the full write-up of how this site works and why the
adapter is shaped this way. In short, two fetches per product:

1. A model-range page (e.g. `/motorhomes/matrix`) renders almost empty on load — the
   real layout/trim/price data only exists in a Laravel Livewire component that mounts
   when it scrolls into view, firing an AJAX call. `BrowserFetcher.fetch_with_capture`
   (scroll=True) drives that and snapshots the JSON response, which gives layout code,
   trim name, berths/seats, RRP, and a per-configuration `id`.
2. That `id` plugs into a predictable, unauthenticated, non-JS PDF URL
   (`configure.adria-mobil.com/<market>/<period>/<id>/pdf`) which is the manufacturer's
   own technical-data sheet: dimensions, MIRO (mass in running order) and max
   authorised weight (MTPLM) are all in there as plain text, one fetch per product,
   through the ordinary `Fetcher`.

Weights/dimensions are *not* attempted from the HTML/JSON — confirmed absent from that
payload during the Phase 4 survey (see the write-up). The PDF is the only source found
for them, matching DESIGN.md's anticipated PDF fallback.

Because step 2 *constructs* a URL rather than following a link, this adapter carries
self-checks that others do not need: the spec sheet has to name the layout it was
fetched for, and its two masses have to imply a positive payload. See `collect`.

    `on_progress` is called with one line of text at each range/product boundary and
    whenever a configuration is silently skipped — a missing PDF URL, a non-200 PDF
    fetch, a PDF that yielded no spec fields (see `_SPEC_PATTERNS`), or one that failed
    a self-check. None of those raise, by design (a mid-sweep parser hiccup shouldn't
    abort every other product), which is exactly why they're worth narrating rather than
    only being visible after the fact by diffing snapshot counts. Defaults to a no-op so
    calling this from a test, or any caller that doesn't want console output, needs
    nothing extra; `cli.py` wires this to `print` for an interactive `fmlv run`.

    **The self-checks, and why two of them drop a product where the third does not.**
    This adapter reaches its numbers by *constructing* a URL out of an id, which no
    other adapter does, so the failure it has to defend against is a whole spec sheet
    belonging to the wrong vehicle — plausible, internally consistent, and invisible
    downstream. A product is therefore dropped when:

    * **the PDF's own title does not name the layout it was fetched for**
      (`pdf_describes_layout`) — direct evidence of exactly that failure; or
    * **mass in running order is not below max authorised weight**, which makes the
      derived payload zero or negative. That is arithmetically impossible for a real
      vehicle, so it means a mis-parse, and a negative payload would sail through
      `validation.py`'s `payload == mtplm - mro` reconciliation check by construction.

    A **cross-source disagreement** on berths or seats (`cross_source_disagreements`)
    only warns, and the product is still proposed. Once the title check has confirmed
    the document is the right vehicle's, the remaining explanation is a definitional
    difference between the two sources rather than a misattribution — Adria's own seats
    row varies by chassis rating, for instance — and dropping the product would throw
    away a correct price and correct dimensions over a question a reviewer is better
    placed to settle. Both figures go into the provenance snippet instead.
