"""Bailey (baileyofbristol.co.uk) — the twelfth adapter, motorhomes and campervans.

See `docs/adapters/bailey.md` for the full write-up. Bailey is the cleanest source
surveyed so far: **one URL is one vehicle**. Every model has its own page under
`/motorhomes/<range>/<slug>/` or `/campervan/<range>/<slug>/`, plain server-rendered HTML
(no JavaScript, no PDF, no login), carrying a "Technical specification" section with one
row per fact and — unlike every manufacturer surveyed before this one — **explicit
literal `Range` and `Model` text fields**:

    Range                                    Adamo
    Model                                    60-2
    Berths                                   2
    Designated Travelling Seats              2
    Chassis                                  Ford Transit skeletal chassis
    Roof Profile                             Low Profile
    Overall Body Length                      6.096m
    Max Width Vehicle with Mirrors Extended  2.740m
    Max Width Vehicle with Mirrors Folded    2.393m
    Overall Height                           2.863m
    MTPLM                                    3500kg
    MRO                                      2827kg
    Total User Payload                       673kg
    OTR Price                                £75,999

Because it is one vehicle per page there is no column to misalign — the real risk on
almost every other manufacturer surveyed (Morelo, Swift, Sunlight, Etrusco, Bürstner all
print several layouts side by side). `Total User Payload == MTPLM - MRO` reconciles
exactly on every page checked, which is a genuine arithmetic check even without a
column-slip failure mode for it to be defending against here.

**Two places where the site's own naming disagrees with the real FMLV export, resolved
two different ways by the requester (2026-08-20):**

* Three "Adamo" models state `Model: XL-I` / `XL-T` / `XL-DL`. FMLV currently holds these
  under a separate range, `Adamo XL`. **Decision: follow the site.** `Range` and `Model`
  are read verbatim, with no `XL-` splitting — `XL-I` is a model within `Adamo`, not a
  second range. This merges the 3 existing `Adamo XL` products into `Adamo` on the first
  run; that is the intended outcome, not a problem to fix.
* Every "Autograph" model states `Range: Autograph`; FMLV holds `Autograph IV`. **Decision:
  correct it** — see `RANGE_NAME_CORRECTIONS`. Purely cosmetic, no vehicles combined.

**Body type is unusually reliable here too**, because Bailey states it directly rather
than this adapter having to infer it:

* Every motorhome states `Roof Profile: Low Profile` — no A-class or over-cab range
  currently exists, so only that one value is mapped; anything else is left unset and
  narrated rather than guessed (see `_MOTORHOME_ROOF_PROFILES`).
* Campervans state a van body-height code (`H3` seen on both ranges) instead, so the
  existing height-threshold rule from `docs/adapters/README.md` is used against the page's
  own `Overall Height` figure. **No current Bailey campervan gets the elevating-roof
  variant**: the pop-top is stated as a factory-fit *optional* extra on specific models
  only ("B65 & B68 only"), never standard, so per the base-vehicle rule it never changes
  the body type. Revisit `_campervan_body_type` if that ever changes.

**Width**: every page gives `Max Width Vehicle with Mirrors Extended` and `...Folded`,
never a mirror-free figure. The base-vehicle rule takes the narrower one — `Folded`.
Campervan pages also carry a plain `Overall Width` that duplicated the mirrors-extended
figure exactly on the one page checked; treated as a template quirk and not read.
