"""Knaus (knaus.com/en-gb) — motorhomes and campervans, KNAUS brand only.

See `docs/adapters/knaus.md` for the full write-up.

**Scope.** Knaus Tabbert AG owns KNAUS, TABBERT, WEINSBERG, T@B, MORELO and RENT AND
TRAVEL. This adapter covers **KNAUS-branded vehicles only** — confirmed by the requester
1 September 2026, and matched by the NCC export dropdown, which lists `Knaus`, `Weinsberg`
and `Morelo` as three separate suppliers. `knaus.com` carries nothing but KNAUS, so the
scoping needs no filtering.

**The range called VAN is a motorhome range, not a campervan range.** VAN TI VANSATION,
VAN TI VW VANSATION and VAN TI PLUS are all coachbuilts and all live under
`/en-gb/motorhomes/`. The campervans are BOXTIME and BOXLIFE PLATINUM SELECTION only.

## Two sources, and why both

**The website is primary.** Each layout has its own page under
`/en-gb/{motorhomes,camper-vans}/<range-slug>/<model-slug>`, plain server-rendered HTML
carrying a 25-row `<dt>`/`<dd>` specification list. One URL is one vehicle, so attribution
is free and there is no column to misalign — the Auto-Trail end of the risk spectrum
rather than the Rimor end. The price and the model year come from the card on the Layouts
index that links the page, not from the page itself.

**The per-range UK price list supplies two things the website cannot.** Each layout page
links its own range's price list on `konfigurator.knaustabbert.de`, so the document is
rediscovered every run rather than hardcoded:

* **`Three-point belts in driving direction`** — the belted travel seats fitted as
  standard, which the website never publishes. See the seats section below.
* **The base `Technically maximum authorised laden mass`.** The website publishes the
  *uprated* figure on two layouts; the price list publishes the base one and prices the
  uprate as an option. See `_MTPLM` below.

It also republishes length, width, height, MRO and price, which agree with the website on
**28 of 28 layouts** — a cross-document check in the Rimor sense, used here to drop a
product whose two sources disagree rather than to guess which is right.

Discovering the price list from the *layout page* rather than from a downloads index is
deliberate: the same brand publishes a German `VAN TI DE | DE` price list and two combined
motorhome/campervan lists, and the layout page links only the English per-range one.

## The traps

**German thousands separators, everywhere.** `3.500 kg` is 3500 and `75.895 GBP` is
£75,895. `_thousands` is the only number parser in this module for that reason.

**Centimetres.** Every dimension is cm; FMLV wants mm.

**`Mass in running order` is printed twice.** 18 of the 28 layouts print the row twice
with two different figures, byte-identical labels and byte-identical tooltips — on the
German site and in the price list too, so it is real in Knaus's data rather than a
rendering bug. `parse_layout_page` takes the **first**, which is the one that pairs with
the `Chassis`/`Engine power`/`Gearbox` rows immediately above it, and carries both into
the provenance snippet so a reviewer can see what was discarded.

**`Maximum payload` is not payload.** The site's `Maximum payload (kg)` and
`Remaining payload (kg)` are EU 2021/535 homologation figures net of passenger mass and
the manufacturer's optional-equipment allowance; the SKY TI VW 650 MEG's is **8 kg** on the
website and **-161 kg** in the price list. Neither is FMLV's payload, and no arithmetic
relating them to the masses holds on any of the 28 layouts. They are never read.
`mh_payload_kilograms` is derived as `MTPLM - MRO`, which is what FMLV's own baseline
holds on 29 of its 33 current rows.

## Seats: the ceiling, the cab, and the real figure

The sources publish four person-counts and only one is `mh_passenger_seats_inc_driver`:

| Row | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Number of persons allowed in driving operation` | both | **type-approval ceiling** |
| `Max. belt-secured seats` | both | fitment ceiling |
| `Automatic three-point belts` | both | 2 on all 28 — the cab's inertia-reel belts |
| `Three-point belts in driving direction` | **price list only** | **belted seats fitted as standard** |

The first is disqualified by Knaus's own words. The price list's legal section defines it
as *"the permissible number of occupants in running order, as determined by the
manufacturer during the type-approval process"*, used to compute a 75 kg-per-passenger
mass — which is exactly the row `docs/adapters/burstner.md` established is not this field.

`Three-point belts in driving direction` reads 2 on 26 layouts and **4** on SKY TI VW
650 MEG and VAN TI PLUS 650 MEG, and the options table corroborates those two: the add-on
`Two folding seats with 3-point seat belts` is `-` (not possible) on the 650 MEG, whose
L-shaped seating group is standard, and only `o` on the 700s. So the 4s are standard
fitment and the 2s are the base vehicle, per the base-vehicle rule.

Decision from the requester, 1 September 2026: record the belted-seat figure even though
FMLV's baseline holds 4 on 32 of 33 rows. This will propose 2 on most products.

## Body type

Derived, and validated against all 33 current FMLV rows before adoption — **33 of 33
agree**, no exceptions either way:

* `/camper-vans/` -> `campervan_high_top`. Every campervan is 2580 mm or 2780 mm, well
  over `HIGH_TOP_ABOVE_MM`, and **no campervan page mentions a pop-top at any height** —
  the word and every synonym appear zero times on all ten — so the silence-means-option
  rule leaves them as plain high tops.
* L!VE I -> `a_class`. The catalogue heads its section *"Welcome to our fully-integrated
  motorhomes"*.
* every other motorhome -> `coach_built_low_profile`, from the catalogue's
  *"Welcome to our semi-integrated motorhomes"*.
