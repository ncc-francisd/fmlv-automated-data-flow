"""Auto-Trail (auto-trail.co.uk) — the sixth adapter, motorhomes and campervans.

See `docs/adapters/auto-trail.md` for the full write-up. Auto-Trail is the cleanest
source surveyed. Every range publishes a "Website Tech Spec" PDF that gives each model a
run of whole pages to itself, with the model name repeated as a running header:

    EXPEDITION COACHBUILT C63
    Sleeps 4
    Total seats 4
    Seatbelts 4 (inc. driver)
    Length 6338mm
    Width (excl. door mirrors) 2373mm
    Height 3060mm
    ...
    Max. gross weight (with 3650kgs no cost option) 3500/3650kg
    Max. gross train weight (with 3650kg upgrade MGTW increases to 4900kg) 4750/4900kg
    Mass in running order 2960kg
    Max. towing weight 1250kg

There are no side-by-side columns anywhere, so the column-misalignment failure that
dominates `morelo.py`, `swift.py` and `sunlight.py` — and that defeated Rimor's
catalogue outright — does not arise. Attribution is free: a number is inside exactly one
model's block or it is nowhere.

Two ranges are both called **Expedition** — a coachbuilt motorhome range and a campervan
range — and nothing in a model's own name separates `EXPEDITION 68` from
`EXPEDITION COACHBUILT C73`. The range therefore always comes from *which document the
model was read out of*, never from the model name. See `DEFAULT_RANGES`.

Price comes from a second source, and is the one join this adapter makes. Auto-Trail's
price and options list PDF is a rasterised image — the whole of page 2 extracts to four
text runs, none of them a price — but each **range page** carries a `Price from` figure
per model in plain HTML. Rendering the price list as images and reading it confirmed that
this website figure is exactly the price list's `ON THE ROAD PRICE` column, on ten of ten
models across two ranges, which is the basis FMLV's guide price records.

The two sources name the same vehicle differently and in a different order — the document
says `V-Line 610 Sport` where the page says `V-Line Sport 610`, and the page says
`Expedition Van 54` where the document says `54` — so the join is on a key with the
range's own words removed, never on position. See `_match_key` and `price_for`.

    all sixteen Auto-Trail campervans are 2680mm. **Does it have an elevating roof?** — and
    critically, *as standard*, because the base-vehicle rule governs here as everywhere.

    Auto-Trail state it in a way that makes the distinction readable:

        Colour coded elevating pop-top roof (bathroom window included)   Cost option <- Expedition
