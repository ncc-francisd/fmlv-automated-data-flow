"""Murvi (murvi.co.uk) — the seventeenth adapter. A Devon van converter, one price list.

See `docs/adapters/murvi.md` for the full write-up. Ten products, and the whole brand fits
in one 20-page PDF discovered from the "PRICE LIST" page:

     Ford Murvi Pimento
    Dimensions
    Overall length  5.531M (18'1")
    Overall height  2.580M (8' 6")
    Overall width 2.059M (6' 9") Mir folded 2.094M (6'10")
    Payload  600 K gs
    PIMENTO  including 20% VAT £77,290.00
    as above  excluding VAT £64,475.00
    MURVI Pimento motorcaravan based on the NEW Ford Transit
    35 Leader (3,500kg GVW) MWB L2H2 High Roof van in White

Each product gets a **pair of whole pages** — a specification page and an options page —
with its name in a running header. There are no side-by-side columns anywhere in the
document, so none of the column-alignment defences that dominate `morelo.py`, `swift.py`
and `sunlight.py` are needed, and Rimor's unattributable-spans problem cannot arise. This
is Auto-Trail's best case: the risk is entirely *which label is this*.

**The website is not a source.** All seven model pages are marketing prose with a photo
gallery and publish no weight, dimension, price, berth or seat at all — bed sizes in inches
are the only measurement on any of them. Each one ends by pointing at this very document:
"please click on 'Price List' as this includes a fully detailed breakdown of the
specification, technical information and the options available for each Murvi model". So
`docs/adapters/README.md`'s "the website overrules the PDF" has nothing to overrule. The
pages are also stale — six unmodified since 2021, and the Morello page still advertises a
Mercedes Sprinter that neither current price list sells — so they are not even a tiebreak.

**Neither brochure is a source either**, and this is where the requester's warning earned
its place. The page titled "Murvi Brochure" links `JAN_22_MURVI_BROCHURE.pdf` (January
2022) and the page titled "NEW MURVI" links `Murvi-2018-Brochure-1.pdf` (2018) — so the
page calling itself NEW carries the eight-year-old document, and here the *filename* is the
honest half rather than the linking page. Both are glossy: zero occurrences of `Payload`,
`Overall length`, `GVW` or a price across the whole 2022 file. Nothing reads them.

Three Murvi-specific decisions, all from the requester and none of them general rules:

* **The chassis goes in the model name**, so a layout sold on both vans becomes two
  products — `Pimento` + `XL Ford` and `Pimento` + `XL Fiat`. FMLV holds these as two rows
  already (7128/7130 and 7129/7135) but leaves range and model *identical* between them,
  distinguishing them only by `base_vehicle_manufacturer`. Decision of 2 September 2026:
  "we're happy to accept separate models for fiat and ford bases … Again don't make this a
  general rule for going forward." A brand doing this again goes back to the requester.
* **Runs are per chassis.** See `DEFAULT_RANGES` and `baseline_in_scope` — this is not a
  convenience, it is what makes the identity above safe.
* **The Fiat Morello XL's contradictory price resolves to £79,956**, narrated every run.
  See `_price_from_pages`.

MANUFACTURER_DISPLAY_NAME = "Murvi"

#: The page a customer clicks for the price list. **Always rediscover the PDF from here
#: rather than pinning a URL.** Murvi's media library holds eighteen superseded price lists
#: back to 2021, all still live and all named to the same pattern, so a pattern loose enough
#: to match `Murvi-price-list-.*\.pdf` matches all nineteen — Swift's lesson with the archive
#: already in place. Nor is the filename's month a reliable version: "June 2025" was uploaded
#: on 2025-07-06 and three separate "March 2025" lists exist. This page carries exactly one
#: link, which is the one a buyer is shown.
PRICE_LIST_PAGE_URL = f"{BASE_URL}/?page_id=1968"

#: Murvi's `--range` selectors are **base vehicles, not FMLV ranges**, and that is the whole
#: mechanism that makes this brand safe. FMLV files a layout sold on both vans as two rows
#: with identical `manufacturer_range` and `model`, so a combined baseline hits
#: `cli._dedupe_baseline`, which collapses same-range/model rows to the newest year — both
#: twins are 2026, the tie breaks on export order, and the two *Fiat* rows (7130, 7135) are
#: silently discarded before the diff begins. Ten products then meet six baseline rows and
#: four land on the wrong `product_id` or are proposed as duplicates of products the NCC
#: already holds.
#:
#: Scoping a run to one chassis removes the collapse entirely, because within a single
#: chassis no two baseline rows share a range and model. Measured against the real
#: 2026-09-02 export: `--range Fiat` matches 6 of 6 correctly, `--range Ford` 2 of 2 (its
#: other two rows are archived, so "new" is the honest answer), and a combined run 4 of 10
#: with two written onto the wrong row. `collect` warns when both are requested together.

#: Shared with `auto_trail.HIGH_TOP_ABOVE_MM`, set by the NCC side on 16 August 2026. Every

HIGH_TOP_ABOVE_MM = 2300

#: The families Murvi sell, longest name first so `Pimento XL` is never read as `Pimento`.
#: Taken from the site navigation and reconciled against the price list, which is the
#: roster check `docs/adapters/README.md` asks for — there is no `sitemap.xml` and no
#: `robots.txt` on this site, so the usual orphan-page sweep is unavailable.
#:
#: `Piccolo` is deliberately absent: it is in the navigation and still has a live page, but
#: it is priced in **neither** the February 2026 nor the October 2025 list, its page has not
#: been modified since June 2021, and its FMLV row carries year 2024 — so
#: `cli._is_current_model_year` already drops it and it cannot be reported as disappeared.

#: The Fiat Morello XL prints two different VAT-inclusive prices, and £79,956 is the right
#: one. Its specification page (19) says £79,956 and its options page (20) says £78,596,
#: with a byte-identical ex-VAT £66,699 on both. Four independent grounds for the higher
#: figure: Morocco XL prints £79,956 on *both* its pages and shares that same ex-VAT figure;
#: the two are the same donor van (Fiat Ducato Maxi XLWB 35, L4H2) with the same dimensions
#: and the same 400kg payload, so they are priced identically by design; FMLV already holds
#: both at the same `rrp_pounds`; and three of the four printings say £79,956.
#:
#: **The same discrepancy is in the October 2025 list**, byte for byte, so it is a
#: long-standing typo in Murvi's document rather than a fresh slip, and it will not fix
#: itself. Requester's decision, 2 September 2026: take £79,956 and narrate it every run.
#:
#: Note this is a *data-quality* override, not a parse failure, which is why it warns rather
#: than dropping the product: the weights and dimensions on that page are fine and agree
#: with FMLV exactly. Keyed on the pair of figures rather than on the model, so the day
#: Murvi correct either page the override stops applying and the disagreement is reported

# --- Patterns -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every one of these is matched against a page's text with newlines flattened to spaces.
# Flattening is safe *here* and would not be on a Sunlight or Morelo page: this document has
# no cells, so no boundary carries meaning — the only thing newlines do is wrap a sentence
# mid-word. What they must tolerate instead is pypdf splitting words internally, which it
# does freely on this file (`600 K gs`, `Mir f olded`, `2.059 M`), hence `\s*` inside almost
# every literal.

#: `MURVI Pimento XL motorcaravan based on the NEW Ford Transit` / `… the "NEW" Fiat Ducato`.
#: This one sentence carries the family *and* the make, which is why identity is read from it
#: rather than from the running header — the headers are corrupted by pypdf on five pages
#: (`FFiat Murvi Morello`, a doubled leading letter) and would need a looser pattern.
_IDENTITY = re.compile(
    r"MURVI\s+(?P<family>[A-Za-z]+(?:\s+XL)?)\s+motorcaravan\s+based\s+on\s+the\s+"
    r"[\"“]?NEW[\"”]?\s+(?P<make>Ford|Fiat)\b",
    re.IGNORECASE,
)

#: `(3,500kg GVW)` — the MTPLM, in the same sentence as the identity. Murvi publish no MRO
#: anywhere, so a product whose GVW cannot be read is a product whose spec block failed.
_GVW = re.compile(r"\(\s*([\d,]+)\s*kg\s*GVW\s*\)", re.IGNORECASE)

#: `MWB L2H2 High Roof van` (Ford) and `MWB High Roof van (L2H2)` (Fiat). The two makes write
#: the code in different positions — the Elddis "same field labelled differently per vehicle
#: type" trap — but the token itself is identical in both, so one pattern serves. It is the
#: donor van's body code, and it is what `_reconciles` checks length and height against.
_BODY_CODE = re.compile(r"\bL(\d)\s*H(\d)\b")

#: `Overall length  5.531M (18'1")`. Anchored on the label and stopping at the first metre
#: figure, which matters most for width: `Overall width 2.059M (6' 9") Mir folded 2.094M`
#: prints the body width first and the **mirrors-folded** width second. FMLV holds 2059 for
#: every Ford, so taking the first is confirmed by the customer's own data — and note this is
#: the first document where the mirrors-folded figure is the *larger* of the two, so "exclude
#: the mirrors" and "take the narrower" happen to agree here for different reasons.
def _dimension_pattern(label: str) -> re.Pattern[str]:
    spaced = r"\s*".join(label)

_LENGTH = _dimension_pattern("Overall length")
_HEIGHT = _dimension_pattern("Overall height")
_WIDTH = _dimension_pattern("Overall width")

#: `Payload  600 K gs`, `Payload  500Kgs`, and on the Ford Pimento XL
#: `Payload 500 K gs (FWD) 340 Kgs (AWD)` — where the first figure is the front-wheel-drive
#: base vehicle and the second needs the optional all-wheel drive. Taking the first is the
#: base-vehicle rule, and FMLV holds 500 for that product.
_PAYLOAD = re.compile(r"P\s*a\s*y\s*l\s*o\s*a\s*d\s*([\d,]+)\s*K\s*g", re.IGNORECASE)

_PRICE_INC = re.compile(r"including\s*20\s*%\s*VAT\s*£\s*([\d,]+)", re.IGNORECASE)

    every product names the donor van's body code in prose, and a body code determines the
    van's exterior, so two Murvis on the same `(make, code)` must publish the **same** length
    and height however different their interiors are.

    Three of the six groups in the February 2026 list have more than one member and all three
    agree, so 7 of the 10 products are checked against a sibling:

    | Ford L3H2 | Morello, Pimento XL          | 5981 x 2580 |
    | Fiat L3H2 | Morello, Pimento XL, Morocco | 5998 x 2540 |
    | Fiat L4H2 | Morocco XL, Morello XL       | 6363 x 2565 |

    Returns `None` when the product reconciles, or the reason it does not — which is a page
    mis-attribution, exactly the failure that otherwise produces plausible, internally
    consistent motorhomes carrying each other's dimensions.

    A single-member group cannot be checked this way and passes; the sanity bounds below are
    what stand in for it, and they are deliberately wide enough to only ever catch a parse
    that has gone badly wrong rather than to second-guess the manufacturer.
