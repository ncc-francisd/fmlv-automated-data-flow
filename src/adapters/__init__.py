"""Manufacturer adapters, and the lookup from a registry row to the code that runs it.

Per DESIGN.md §5.1 this package is "the only manufacturer-specific code". `base.py`
defines what an adapter is; each sibling module is one. A module satisfies the
`Adapter` protocol structurally — `adria.collect` has the right shape — so an adapter
is a module here, not a class that has to be instantiated.

`ADAPTERS` is keyed by `(Manufacturer.fmlv_manufacturer, VehicleClass)` rather than by
`manufacturer_id`. The name column is required to match the FMLV export's `manufacturer`
value exactly, which makes it the same string the baseline is filtered on, and it does not
depend on the still-open question of what `manufacturer_id` actually is or whether it is
stable (TODO.md, "For Ben").

The product area is in the key because a manufacturer can need **two adapters**. FMLV keeps
motorhomes and touring caravans as separate exports with separate schemas (DESIGN.md §3),
and eight of the registered manufacturers build both — Bailey's caravans live on the same
site as its motorhomes, under different URLs, with a different spec table and a different
set of columns to fill. Those are two different collect() implementations producing two
differently-shaped products, not one adapter with a flag.

An adapter says which area it serves with a module-level `VEHICLE_CLASS`. Omitting it means
motorhomes, so the seventeen adapters written before caravans existed need no edit — the
same `getattr` opt-in `DEFAULT_RANGES` and `baseline_in_scope` use.
