"""Wingamm (wingamm.com) — the thirteenth adapter. Italian, fibreglass monocoque.

See `docs/adapters/wingamm.md` for the full write-up. Eight products in three ranges, and
the whole brand fits in five PDFs listed at `/en/download/`:

    External length MM 6.103
    External width MM 2.240
    External height MM 3.030
    Overall maximum weight KG 3.500
    Weight in running order KG 3.047
    Payload KG 453

One document per range, `label unit value` per line, no side-by-side columns anywhere —
so none of the column-alignment defences that dominate `morelo.py`, `swift.py` and
`sunlight.py` are needed. The risk here is entirely **which label is this**, the
Auto-Trail failure mode, and Wingamm make it worse than Auto-Trail do: five documents use
five different names for the maximum laden weight, three for the seat count, two for the
berths, and one of them omits the mass in running order altogether. See `_MTPLM_LABELS`.

Three things come from the website rather than the PDFs, each for a stated reason:

* **The roster**, from the models index, so a new layout is noticed rather than silently
  missed. Identity itself cannot come from there — see `_DOCUMENTS`.
* **Seats and berths**, from each layout's own page, because the two 2023 catalogues
  (Brownie, City Pro) emit their second technical page as a block of labels followed by a
  block of values, which is exactly the positional misalignment
  `docs/adapters/README.md` forbids pairing up. The three Oasi catalogues state both
  inline, and those are used to check the page rather than replace it.
* **The base vehicle**, from each page's `Drive:` line.

**Dimensions come from the PDFs even though the website disagrees**, which inverts
`docs/adapters/README.md`'s "the website overrules the PDF". The test that rule sets is
not "which is newer" but "can I show one of them is wrong?", and here the website
contradicts *itself*: the index cards give every Oasi 2248 x 3020, the 540.1 and 610 ST
pages 2248 x 2961, the 610 GL and 610 M pages 2240 x 3030, and both 690 pages omit width
and height entirely — for six vehicles sharing one monocoque cross-section. All three
catalogues say 2240 x 3030, and so does every Oasi row already in FMLV. See the survey.

**No price is collected**, though Wingamm publish one. The Oasi catalogues price each
layout in euro *ex works, VAT excluded*, and the Brownie and City Pro price lists exist
only in Italian and quote *VAT included* — so the five documents do not even share a
basis. FMLV holds pound prices from a UK importer list that is not on the website, which
price the three 610 layouts differently where every Wingamm document prices them
identically. Proposing the euro figure would overwrite eight good UK prices with
something well short of what a buyer pays, on a brand where right-hand drive is itself a
EUR 3.000 option. The euro figure is narrated through `on_progress` so it reaches the run
log, and deliberately never reaches a `Motorhome`.

    """One catalogue, and the layouts FMLV holds against it.

    `layouts` maps a model page's slug to **FMLV's own `model` string**, which is why it
    is declared rather than derived. Two independent reasons:

    * The strings are not reconstructible from anything Wingamm publish. FMLV holds
      `610GL` unspaced, `690 TWINS` spaced and capitalised, and `690G` unspaced, against a
      site that writes "Oasi 610 GL" and a catalogue that writes "OASI 690 G". Emitting a
      derived form would cost a weaker fuzzy match on every product and then propose a
      rename on each one that did match — see `docs/adapters/README.md`.
    * The index's card titles are wrong twice over. The 690 G card is titled "Oasis 690 G"
      (confirmed as a typo by the requester, 26 August 2026) and the 610 M card is titled
      "Oasi 610 GL", so the page appears to show the GL twice and the M not at all. Only
      the `href` identifies a card, and only the slug is stable.

    `fmlv_range` is separate from `label` because the three Oasi documents are three
    documents but one range. `label` is the `--range` selector and must stay unique;
    `cli.resolve_ranges` keys on it and would otherwise collapse the three into one.

#:
#: Worth stating because the same page argues the other way if read literally: *"City Pro

#: because what the classification describes is the vehicle a buyer sees: van-shaped,

#: What FMLV still calls the Brownie, so the correction can be proposed at all.
#:
#: FMLV files it under `manufacturer_range` "Coach Built low profile" — a body type in the
#: range column — and the requester confirmed on 26 August 2026 that the ranges are
#: Brownie, City Pro and Oasi.
#:
#: **Emitting the right name alone does not work.** `diff/matching.py` scores identity as a
#: Jaccard similarity on the range-plus-model word bag, and "Brownie" against "Coach Built
#: low profile Brownie" is `{brownie}` against `{coach, built, low, profile, brownie}` —
#: **0.200 against a 0.5 threshold.** Run #30 proved it: the scraped Brownie was reported
#: as a new product and the real one, `product_id` 5855, as disappeared. For a year the
#: adapter emitted FMLV's own wrong range with no provenance, so nothing was proposed and
#: the product at least kept its history.
#:
#: Naming the rename fixes both halves at once: the scraped identity is scored as the name
#: FMLV holds, so the product matches at **1.000**, while the emitted name and its
#: provenance propose `Coach Built low profile` -> `Brownie` through the ordinary review.
#:
#: **Delete this entry once a fresh export shows `Brownie`.** The rename was accepted in
#: review on 16 September 2026, so it is waiting on the export, not the reviewer. Leaving it
#: until then is safe — `token_similarity` scores the product's own name as well as the
#: rewritten one and takes the better, so this matches the old range and the corrected one
#: alike. `diff.stale_renames` narrates it once the baseline has moved.
