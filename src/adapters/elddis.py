"""Elddis (elddis.co.uk) — the thirteenth adapter, motorhomes and campervans.

See `docs/adapters/elddis.md` for the full write-up. Structurally this is the safest
source surveyed: **one URL is one vehicle**, plain server-rendered HTML, no JavaScript,
and every number sits in a labelled `Label: value` block that the page heads "Technical
Specification". There are no columns, so the misattribution failure that dominates the
PDF adapters cannot happen here.

The website is the source for everything **except the Evolve ranges' weights**, which are
demonstrably wrong on the site and are taken from Elddis's own 2026 brochure instead — see
`apply_brochure_weights`. The brochure is fetched only when an Evolve range is in scope,
because the two editions are 100MB and 120MB.

    Technical Specification
    Year: 2026
    Model: Whirlwind GT 155
    Base Vehicle: Peugeot X250 Boxer Euro 6E Engine Motorhome Chassis
    Number of Berths : 4
    Number of Seat Belts: 4
    Exterior Length: 7373mm/24'2"
    Overall Width Including Wing Mirrors: 2678mm/8'9"
    Overall Body Width: 2239mm/7'4"
    Overall Height Including Aerial: 2925mm/9'7"
    Mass in Running Order (MIRO): 2926kgs/57.60cwt
    Maximum User Payload: 530kgs/10.43cwt
    M.T.P.L.M: 3500kgs/68.89cwt
    NOTES

The field mapping is not inferred — it was checked against the 29 products FMLV already
holds and agrees on berths, seats, MRO, MTPLM, length and width **29 of 29**, payload
28 of 29 and height 27 of 29. In particular `Overall Body Width` is the width FMLV holds,
not `Overall Width Including Wing Mirrors`, which the base-vehicle rule in
`docs/adapters/README.md` would have chosen anyway. `Maximum Headroom` and `Interior
Width` are decoys — both are always present, and `Maximum Headroom` is 2080 on every
motorhome.

**The self-check is a band, not an equality.** Elddis publishes MIRO, MTPLM *and*
payload, and its own footnote declares the reason they do not simply subtract:

    Note 9: A MIRO tolerance of +1.5% is permitted as per the NCC COP 304/402
    regulation to account for build variance

Most models publish `payload = MTPLM - MIRO * 1.015`; a minority publish the plain
`MTPLM - MIRO`. Both are legitimate, so `_reconciles` accepts the closed interval between
them — see its docstring. A consequence worth knowing: `validation._validate_payload`
tests the exact equality, so it warns on most Elddis products. That is **pre-existing, not
caused here** — FMLV's own baseline already carries the tolerance-adjusted figures.

**Name collisions, flagged by the requester (2026-08-21) and worse than they look.**
"Whirlwind" names a motorhome range, a campervan range *and* a caravan range; "Autoquest"
names one motorhome range and three campervan ranges. Two consequences:

* Layout numbers repeat across ranges — `105`-`196+` appear in Whirlwind GT, Whirlwind GT
  Evolve *and* Autoquest APEX — so nothing can be keyed on the model half alone.
* `diff/matching.py` scores `Whirlwind GT 155` against `Whirlwind GT Evolve 155` at 0.750
  and `Avalon 250` against `Avalon Evolve 250` at 0.667, both above its 0.5 accept
  threshold and above Adria's documented *good* match. The Evolve ranges are all new
  products whose most plausible wrong partner is already in the baseline.

**FMLV folds campervans into the motorhome range**, which the website does not suggest and
only the real export revealed. `Autoquest Apex` holds both the 8 motorhomes (`105`…) and
the 4 campervans (`CV20`…); the site's separate `Autoquest CV` range collapses to range
`Autoquest`. See `_SEGMENT_RANGES`. The site's `196+` is `196P` in FMLV — getting that
wrong costs twice, since the product reads as new *and* its baseline row reads as gone.

**Price is the published headline, as-is** (decision from the NCC side, 2026-08-21). Elddis
labels it "OTR" and then charges a £1,690 OTR fee on top, so the true on-the-road figure is
£1,690 higher and is never printed as a single number; FMLV's existing rows hold the
headline *minus* £1,690. Recording the headline therefore proposes a +£1,690 change on
every matched product on the first run. That is the intended outcome, not a parse error.

**The three Whirlwind GTV campervans are the trap** and every defence below exists for
them: dimensions in metres not millimetres, masses with thousands separators, height given
`Excluding Aerial` where every other model gives `Including Aerial`, berths and seats as
prose, and weights split four ways (Fixed Roof / Pop Top x Manual / Automatic) with the
model name and a seat count embedded in the label on the 563. The base vehicle is
Fixed Roof + Manual, falling back to Automatic where no manual figure exists — the GTV 554
is automatic-only. Selected that way the self-check passes exactly.

#: `Autoquest Apex` (distinguished only by the `CV` prefix on the model half), and the
#: site's `Autoquest CV` range under the bare name `Autoquest`. Emitting the site's own

#: A campervan taller than this is a high top — the roof line materially above the side

#: value on all 8 matched Elddis campervans, which is the reason for reusing it rather
#: than inventing a brand-specific figure: every Elddis van is 2610mm or 2670mm, so all of
#: them are high tops on this rule.
HIGH_TOP_ABOVE_MM = 2300

#: Elddis's only motorhome body shape. The site never uses the words "low profile",
#: "coach built", "high top" or "A-class" — zero occurrences on any page — so this cannot
#: be read from its wording. FMLV holds all 21 of its current Elddis motorhomes as low
#: profile across Whirlwind GT, Autoquest Apex and Avalon, and the range contains no
#: over-cab-bed or A-class model. The 29 "overcab pod" mentions on the site are a styling
#: feature, not a bed, and appear on ranges FMLV already files as low profile.
_MOTORHOME_BODY_TYPE = BodyType.COACH_BUILT_LOW_PROFILE

#: A pop-top fitted **as standard**, which does change the body type. Only the three CV80
#: layouts say this, and they say it twice ("comes with a pop-top with an opening
#: Skylight", "adds a pop-top roof to create a flexible 4-berth campervan under 6m");
#: CV20, CV40 and CV60 never mention a pop-top at all.
#:
#: Matching a positive statement — rather than looking for the *absence* of the word
#: "option" — is what implements `README.md`'s rule that **silence means option**: a page
#: that does not say the roof is included is taken not to have one, because a pop-top is a
#: headline selling feature and a manufacturer fitting one as standard says so. Confirmed
#: for Autoquest CV60 by the requester on 2026-08-21, which is why the adapter's correction
#: of FMLV's `campervan_high_top_elevating_roof` there is right rather than a guess.
#:
#: Contrast the Whirlwind GTVs, which offer one as a *cost option* ("All models are
#: available as a pop-top 5 berth version") and are excluded by `_offers_pop_top_variant`
#: below. Note they mention a pop-top six to eleven times each — far more than the CV80s —
#: so mention count is emphatically not the signal, and a naive keyword search would give
#: all three an elevating roof they do not have as standard.

    Evolve page — byte for byte. The Evolve packs add a solar panel, an awning, cab blinds,
    an alarm and a tracker, so the vehicles cannot weigh the same, and the 2026 brochure
    agrees: it gives Evolve +41 to +58kg of MIRO with payload down by the matching amount.
    The Autoquest Evolve CV80 gains only +24kg, and its own equipment list says
    "Solar panel not available for Evolve CV80" — the one van without the panel is the one
    with the smaller gain, which is not a coincidence bad data produces.

    Confirmed by the requester on 25 August 2026, who is querying it with Erwin Hymer. The
    override should be removed once Elddis correct their site, and the survey document says
    so.

    the current 2026 edition, it is internally consistent, and the website is provably
    wrong — its Evolve figures are a copy of a different vehicle's. The rule's reasoning
    does not apply, so the rule does not either. Only the three Evolve ranges are touched;
