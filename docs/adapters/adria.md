# Adria Mobil (adria.co.uk) — Phase 4 survey and first adapter

Manufacturer ID 3, priority 1 pilot. Code: `adapters/adria.py`. Tests:
`tests/adapters/test_adria.py` (against real captured fixtures, no network).

## Site shape

`adria.co.uk` (the UK importer site — used over the group site `adria-mobil.com`
because it has GBP pricing, which is what the FMLV export needs) is built on
**Laravel + Livewire + Alpine.js**. A model-range page like `/motorhomes/matrix`
renders almost empty: no price, no specs, just marketing copy and trim names.

The real data loads in two separate steps, discovered by watching the network panel
while actually interacting with the rendered page — neither was visible from a plain
HTTP fetch or from a browser fetch that only waited for `networkidle`:

### 1. Layout/trim/price — a scroll-triggered Livewire AJAX call

The page's layout-selector component only mounts when it scrolls into the viewport
(`x-intersect` — an Alpine.js intersection observer), firing `POST /livewire/update`.
Nothing requests this on page load; a headless fetch that doesn't scroll never sees it.
This is why `fetch/browser.py` gained `BrowserFetcher.fetch_with_capture(scroll=True)` —
a generic capability (see [`README.md`](README.md)), not Adria-specific.

The response body is a JSON envelope; the useful part is
`components[0].snapshot` (itself a JSON string) `.data.apiData`, which is wrapped in
**Livewire v3's wire-format**: every array/collection is serialised as a 2-element
`[data, meta]` pair rather than a plain list. `adria.unwrap_livewire()` undoes this
recursively. Once unwrapped, `apiData` is a list of layouts (e.g. "670 DC"), each with
a `products` list of sellable trim configurations (e.g. "Supreme Alde RHD"), each
carrying an `id`, a `priceString`/`price.retail_price_with_tax` (already whole GBP,
matches the displayed price exactly), `berths`, `seats`, and a `configuratorURL`.

Weights and dimensions are **not** in this payload — checked byte-for-byte during the
survey. Some sibling nodes under the same layout carry raw chassis `length`/`width`
figures with `id: null` (a "base vehicle" entry, not a sellable configuration) — the
adapter skips these; the PDF's dimensions are used instead, since they're per-
configuration rather than per-chassis.

### 2. Weights/dimensions — a per-configuration PDF, plain HTTP

The page has a "download technical data" button (`showDownloadTechnicalDataLink`).
Following it leads to `configure.adria-mobil.com` — a second Livewire app, an
interactive step-by-step configurator — but the PDF it ultimately serves turned out to
sit at a **predictable, unauthenticated URL**:

```
https://configure.adria-mobil.com/<market>/<period>/<product id>/pdf
```

`<market>`/`<period>` (`gb`/`25-26`) and `<product id>` all come straight out of the
JSON's `configuratorURL` and `id` fields, so `adria.technical_data_pdf_url()` builds it
without ever driving the configurator itself. This is a plain `Fetcher.fetch()` — no
browser, no session/cookies needed; confirmed with a fresh `httpx` client with no prior
state.

The PDF (~5 MB, 8 pages) is a real technical spec sheet. Pages 2–3 ("B. Dimensions and
weights") give clean `Label (unit) value` lines that `parse_technical_data_pdf()`
regexes out: `Body length (mm)`, `Total width (mm)`, `Total height (mm)`, `Mass in
running order (MIRO-min, kg)` → `mro_kilograms`, `Max authorised weight (kg)` →
`mtplm_kilograms`. Page 8 ("O. Collection") gives `Nr. of berths` / `Nr. of seats`
cleanly too. `mh_payload_kilograms` is computed as `mtplm - mro` rather than parsed —
the PDF's closest line ("max loading weight... with All Inclusive Pack weight
deducted") measures something subtly different and isn't a reliable match.

Everything past those two sections is ~50 lines of optional equipment, ticked or
crossed out per configuration (✕ = not fitted) — this is where the ~40 layout flags
would come from, but parsing it reliably is a harder problem than the numeric fields
and, per DESIGN.md §4.3, lower priority for an *existing* product. **Not attempted in
this first adapter** — a known, deliberate gap, not an oversight.

### 3. The 60Y anniversary editions — same shape, three unlisted pages

Added 2026-08-20. Adria's 60th-anniversary editions sit at `/60y/matrix`, `/60y/coral`
and `/60y/twin`, one layout each, and are built exactly like an ordinary range page —
same Livewire component, same `configuratorURL`, same technical-data PDF.

Two things about them are worth carrying forward:

- **They are in no index.** `/motorhomes` and `/campervans` list nine ranges between
  them and none of these three. This is `docs/adapters/README.md`'s "no single menu is a
  complete roster" again, and it is why the follow-up below — reading the range list off
  the index pages instead of hardcoding it — would have *lost* these three rather than
  found them. Whatever replaces `RANGES` has to reconcile against a second source.
- **Neither is their data duplicated.** `/motorhomes/matrix` returns seven
  configurations and none is the 60Y (checked 2026-08-20), so sweeping these pages adds
  products rather than double-counting existing ones.

**FMLV files them under the ordinary range, marked in the model** — product 8195 is
range `Matrix`, model `670 SL 60Y`, per `docs/adapters/README.md`'s rule that the export
decides these strings. That forced `RangeConfig` to separate two things this adapter had
previously treated as one string:

| | Ordinary range | 60Y edition |
|---|---|---|
| `label` — what `--range` and `schedule.csv` name | `Matrix` | `Matrix 60Y` |
| `fmlv_range` — what lands in `manufacturer_range` | `Matrix` | `Matrix` |
| Model | layout + trim (`670 DC Supreme Alde RHD`) | layout + `60Y` (`670 SL 60Y`) |

The trim is dropped for a 60Y product because it carries nothing: it is a different
shape on each of the three pages (`60 years RHD`, `Coral 60Y 670 DL`, `Twin 60Y 640
SGX`) and on two of them merely repeats the layout code. Each PDF titles itself exactly
as FMLV names the product (`MATRIX 670 SL 60Y`), which is a useful independent
confirmation that this naming is Adria's own and not an invention of this adapter.

**A consequence worth knowing about, because it reaches outside the adapter.** A
`--range`-narrowed run filters the baseline export so it only diffs against rows in the
swept ranges. That filter used to be a match on `manufacturer_range`, which cannot work
once label and range differ — and it fails destructively in *both* directions: too
narrow and the 60Y products find no baseline, are classified `NEW_PRODUCT`, and would be
uploaded as duplicates of products the NCC already holds; too wide and `--range Matrix`
pulls in the 60Y row it never sweeps and reports a live product as disappeared. So
`cli.baseline_scope` now delegates to an optional `baseline_in_scope(motorhome, labels)`
the adapter may declare — the same `getattr` opt-in as `DEFAULT_RANGES`, leaving every
other adapter untouched. Adria's implementation reads the `60Y` suffix on `model`,
because that is the only place FMLV records the distinction at all.

### The scroll bug these pages exposed

All three returned **zero** configurations at first, and the reason was not in this
adapter: `BrowserFetcher._scroll_to_bottom` scrolled in 2000px steps against a 720px
viewport. That tiles a page with gaps, and the element carrying Adria's `x-intersect` is
**20px tall** — on these three pages it landed in a gap, was never on screen while the
page was still, and its intersection observer never fired. On `/motorhomes/matrix` the
same element happens to land inside a rest position, which is the only reason the
adapter ever worked.

The fix is generic and lives in `fetch/browser.py`: no step may exceed half a viewport,
so consecutive positions overlap and nothing can be skipped. Regression test:
`tests/fetch/test_browser.py::test_fetch_with_capture_finds_a_trigger_that_falls_between_scroll_steps`.

**The general lesson is about the failure mode, not the arithmetic.** A page yielding no
captures is indistinguishable from a page that has no lazy-loaded data, so this bug
presents as "those pages must be built differently" and can silently cost a whole range
on any future JS-driven site. `collect` now narrates a range page that made no
`livewire/update` call at all, so the next occurrence says so out loud.

## Self-checks

Added 2026-08-20, and this adapter needs them more than any other: it reaches its
weights and dimensions by **constructing** a URL from an id rather than following a
link, so the failure to defend against is a spec sheet that belongs to a different
vehicle — plausible, internally consistent, and invisible to everything downstream.

Adria publishes no payload to reconcile against its two masses (see above), so the
redundancy `docs/adapters/README.md` asks for is found in two other places:

| Check | What it catches | On failure |
|---|---|---|
| The PDF's own running title names the layout it was fetched for | A constructed URL resolving to another vehicle's sheet | **Drop** |
| Mass in running order is below max authorised weight | A mis-parse; a non-positive payload, which would otherwise satisfy `validation.py`'s `payload == mtplm - mro` check by construction | **Drop** |
| The range page's JSON and the PDF agree on berths and seats | A definitional difference between two independently maintained sources | **Warn, keep, show both** |

The third only warns *because* the first exists. Once the title has confirmed the
document is the right vehicle's, a berths disagreement is a question about definitions —
Adria's seats row varies by chassis rating — and dropping the product would discard a
correct price and correct dimensions over something a reviewer is better placed to
settle. Both figures go into the provenance snippet instead.

The title is read from the running footer (`<title>\nCreated date:`), which every page
repeats, rather than from the first line of the extracted text — it is then the document
*stating* what it describes rather than an assumption about layout.

## Fields added 2026-08-20

- **`base_vehicle_manufacturer`**, from the spec sheet's own chassis section heading
  (`CA. Fiat Chassis`, `CB. Mercedes Chassis`). Adria's spelling is already FMLV's:
  `Fiat`, `Mercedes`, `MAN`, `Renault` are the four in the real baseline, and `Mercedes`
  rather than `Mercedes-Benz` matches on both sides. Deliberately *not* read from the
  `Chassis type ...` line, which gives the variant (`special`, `panel van`, `AL - KO`)
  and not the manufacturer. A document whose headings disagree leaves the field unset
  rather than taking the first hit. Validated on the live Matrix run: it agreed with the
  baseline on all six existing rows and proposed a value only where the baseline was
  blank.
- **`mh_payload_kilograms` now carries provenance**, so it is actually diffed. It was
  computed before but had no `Provenance` entry, and `diff/compare.py` only compares
  fields the provenance dict covers — so a payload change was silently never proposed.
  The snippet shows the subtraction, as `burstner.py` does.
- **Provenance snippets now keep the qualifier the recorded figure drops.** Adria writes
  `Nr. of seats 3 AT 3,500KG (4 AT 3,650KG)` and `Nr. of berths 2 (OPTIONAL 3RD BERTH)`;
  the base figure is what FMLV records per `docs/adapters/README.md`, but the snippet
  stopped at the digit and threw the rest away. On a seats row that differs by chassis
  rating, the discarded half was the whole story.

## Validation against the real baseline export

Ran the adapter live against the Matrix range (7 configurations) and compared to the
41-row Adria baseline (`csv-examples/…/motorhome-campervans.xlsx`):

- **`MB 670 SL` and `MB 670 DL`**: MRO, MTPLM *and* RRP all matched the baseline
  exactly. Strong evidence the parse is genuinely correct, not coincidentally
  plausible.
- Several other rows (`670 DC`, `670 SC`, `670 SL`) matched dimensions and RRP but
  showed a higher MTPLM (3650kg vs baseline's 3500kg) on the same body code — page 4 of
  the PDF mentions an "extended homologation" option (35L → 36.5L Fiat chassis rating).
  Read as a genuine current-vs-baseline delta worth a reviewer's attention, exactly the
  behaviour DESIGN.md §6.4 asks for (surface everything, no threshold) — not treated as
  a bug and not silently reconciled.

## Known gaps / follow-ups

- **Range list is hardcoded** (`RANGES` in `adria.py`), read off the site nav by hand
  during the survey — 6 motorhome ranges + 3 campervan ranges, re-confirmed unchanged
  2026-08-20, plus the 3 60Y pages. A new range won't be picked up until the constant is
  updated. Reading it dynamically from the `/motorhomes` and `/campervans` index pages
  is the obvious fix but is **not sufficient on its own**: neither index lists any of
  the three 60Y pages, so an index-driven roster would have to be reconciled against a
  second source or it would quietly drop them.
- **Model naming won't match the baseline's naming 1:1.** The site names a
  configuration by layout code + trim (`"670 DC" + "Supreme Alde RHD"`); the baseline
  export uses `"Supreme 670 DC"`. Same product, different word order/casing — Phase 5's
  matching logic will need to handle this, not exact-string-match on `model`.
  `manufacturer_range` in the baseline is also inconsistently cased/punctuated for at
  least one row (`"Matrix Supreme"` vs `"Matrix"` for a `Supreme MB` product) — a
  pre-existing baseline quirk, not something this adapter introduced.
- **Layout flags (body type, bed types, bathroom layout, heating, …) are not
  extracted.** Deliberately deferred — see above. One caution for whoever picks this up:
  the `✕` semantics recorded above (`✕` = not fitted) does **not** survive contact with
  the sheets. `Driver airbag ✕`, `ABS + EBD ✕` and `Right hand drive ✕` all appear on a
  RHD vehicle, while the *unmarked* lines are things like `Roof-mounted air conditioning`
  and `Solar panel 1x (set)` — which reads as the opposite convention. Settle this
  against a known product before writing any of it: getting it backwards would flip
  ~40 columns on every product at once.
- **Cost/politeness at full scale**: each PDF is ~5 MB; a full run across all 9 ranges
  with several configurations each means dozens of multi-megabyte fetches. Fine at
  prototype scale per DESIGN.md §8.1, but worth keeping an eye on once content-hash
  gating (Phase 3, already built) is wired up against a previous run's hashes — most of
  these won't need re-fetching once a manufacturer has been run once.

## The habitation findings — 10 September 2026

The deferral above is closed, and the caution in it was the right one: **`✕` means
fitted**, not crossed out. The sheets settle it themselves — `Right hand drive ✕` and
`Driver airbag ✕` appear on a right-hand-drive vehicle, and `Roof-mounted air
conditioning system` is unmarked on the Matrix and marked on the flagship Supersonic,
which is the way round that makes sense. Getting it backwards would have flipped every
habitation field on every Adria product at once, exactly as the note warned.

Two more things had to be settled before anything could be read:

* **A line carrying a value is fitted too.** `Refrigerator 142 L` has a capacity where
  its neighbours have a mark, and it is the fridge line on every sheet.
* **The reading starts at the first lettered section** (`A.`, `B.`, … `K. Heating/Air
  Conditioning`). Above it sit the cover figures and the **ALL INCLUSIVE PACK**, a
  priced option pack. Its contents may also be marked as fitted further down — that is
  what buying the pack does — but the listing itself is not evidence of fitment.

One sheet is one configuration, so unlike almost every other brand here there is nothing
to attribute: all four factual fields come out per product, and so do the beds.

| | Matrix Supreme 670 DC | Matrix 670 SL (60Y) | Supersonic 780 DC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `heating` | `Hot-water heating system Alde Compact 3030` → wet | `Gas-electric heater Truma Combi 6E` → blown air | Alde, as the Matrix |
| `refrigeration` | `Refrigerator 142 L` | `Refrigerator 142 L` | `Refrigerator 177 L` |
| `shower_toilet_separated` | `Separate shower cabin with solid door` → yes | the same | the same |
| `bed_types` | `Central bed` → island | `Single beds` → fixed separate | `Central bed` → island |

The beds are the proof that the attribution is real: the two Matrix layouts differ, and
they differ correctly.

**No sheet names a microwave anywhere**, and these sheets itemise every fitting a
configuration has, so the absence is recorded with that reasoning and
`findings.SILENCE_MEANS` supplies the recommendation.
