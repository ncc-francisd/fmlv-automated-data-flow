"""A touring-caravan run end to end: scrape -> diff -> persist -> upload CSV.

The adapter, schema, model, diff and output layers all have their own tests. This one
exists because the failure that would hurt most is none of theirs: every part working and
the *seams* between them being motorhome-shaped, so a caravan run quietly produces a
68-column motorhome CSV, or diffs caravan scrapes against a motorhome baseline and calls
every product new.

Runs against the real Bailey caravan export where it is present, and skips rather than
fails when it is not — `data/exports` is gitignored.
