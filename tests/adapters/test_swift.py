"""Tests for the Swift adapter's pure parsing functions, against real page and PDF text.

The fixtures are Swift's own 2027 pages and quick guides, captured 2026-08-28 — see
`docs/adapters/swift.md`. Three shapes are exercised because all three bit during the
rewrite: the category index pages (which carry a *global* nav, so they link the other
category's ranges too), the range pages' embedded layout JSON, and the quick guides'
two different ways of printing a payload.

No network and no PDF parsing here; `fetch.pdf` is covered in `tests/fetch/test_pdf.py`.
