# "determined by the manufacturer in what is referred to as the type-approval
# procedure". So its lower bound is not necessarily standard fitment, and the FMLV
# baseline is what proves the difference — B66 published 4 and FMLV holds 4 on all

# layouts, and Habiton publishes 4 where FMLV holds 2 on both 6.0s.

# The Signature lounge is face-to-face with no belted rear seats as standard; the belted
# seats come from "Sofa convertible to L-shaped bench (4 belted seats in total)", an
# equipment item whose per-layout availability is marked with glyphs `extract_text`
# drops. The SMT document does not mention the bench at all and still publishes `4 - 5`.
