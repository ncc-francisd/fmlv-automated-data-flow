"""Swift's touring-caravan adapter — the second caravan adapter, and the first built on
a motorhome sibling's fetching rather than on `bailey_caravan.py`.

Fixtures were saved from the live site on 3 September 2026, trimmed the same way the
motorhome ones were: every `<script>` dropped **except** the `data-product-layouts-data`
block, plus `<style>` blocks and comments. The rest of the page is kept because the
headroom this adapter reads is in the range highlights prose, hundreds of KB away from
the JSON, and a fixture trimmed to "the spec data" would lose it.

Three of the seven range pages, chosen because each carries a trap:

* **Sprite** — the sub-1250kg micro trap (Alpine 4 is 1247kg), and prose stating
  `Overall body width 2.25m` where the JSON, the quick guide and FMLV all say 2.23m.
* **Conqueror Grande** — `560L`/`650L` model names, a range mixing single and twin axles,
  and the only duplicate MTPLM in the whole line-up (1886kg, twice).
* **Elegance Grande** — the payload the guide prints as one 201kg figure and FMLV splits
  into 160kg personal effects plus 41kg optional equipment.
