"""Murvi's parsing functions, against real captured pages of the February 2026 price list.

No network and no PDF parsing here — `tests/fetch/test_pdf.py` covers extraction, and the
`murvi_*.txt` fixtures are what it produces. Every fixture is one page of the real document,
and each was chosen because it carries a trap the parser had to survive:

* **`ford_pimento_spec`** — `Payload  600 K gs` and `Mir f olded`, pypdf splitting words
  mid-token, and the mirrors-folded width printed *after* and *wider than* the body width.
* **`ford_pimento_xl_spec`** — `Payload 500 K gs (FWD) 340 Kgs (AWD)`, two payloads where
  only the front-wheel-drive base vehicle's counts.
* **`ford_morello_xl_spec`** — the one product on a 4,000kg GVW and the only `L4H3`.
* **`fiat_morocco_xl_spec`** — Fiat parenthesise the body code (`High Roof van (L4H2)`)
  where Ford put it inline (`MWB L2H2 High Roof`), the Elddis label trap in miniature.
* **`fiat_morello_xl_spec`** + **`fiat_morello_xl_options`** — the long-standing price
  contradiction, £79,956 against £78,596 on an identical ex-VAT figure.
* **`ford_pimento_options`** — an options page, which carries the same running header and
  the same price but no `Dimensions` block, and must not parse as a product.
* **`ford_pimento_xl_options`** — the same, and worse: it carries a stray
  `Ford Murvi Morello` header, Murvi's own layout error, which must not be read as a price
  for the Morello.
* **`price_list_page.html`** — trimmed to the block holding the one link.
