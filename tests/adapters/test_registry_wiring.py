"""Every adapter module is fully wired in, and matches a real registry row.

Adding an adapter takes three separate edits to `src/adapters/__init__.py` — the import,
the `ADAPTERS` entry and `__all__` — plus a matching row in `config/manufacturers.csv`.
Missing any of them **fails silently**: `adapter_for()` returns `None`, which the pipeline
treats as the entirely normal "nobody has written an adapter for this brand yet" state
(see its docstring). Nothing raises. The manufacturer simply never appears in the review
app's trigger dropdown and scheduled sweeps skip it, which is indistinguishable from the
adapter not existing.

So these tests turn a silent omission into a red test. Modules are discovered with
`pkgutil` rather than listed, for the same reason `test_cli.py` iterates `ADAPTERS` — a
test naming the four current adapters would go stale the moment a fifth is written, which
is exactly when it is needed.
