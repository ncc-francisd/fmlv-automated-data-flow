"""Migrating a run store that predates a schema change.

`db.connect` applies `schema.sql` with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, which does nothing
to a table that already exists — so every column and constraint added after the first
release needs its own migration. These tests build a database in the *old* shape, with
real review history in it, and assert that opening it upgrades it without losing
anything.

That matters because the deployed VM carries the only copy of the review history
(`docs/deploy-app-on-server.md`): a migration that silently dropped `proposed_change`
rows would destroy work reviewers had already done, and would do it on a machine where
nobody was watching.
